# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an intelligent comment system for a blog/website using Cloudflare's D1 database, Workers, and AI capabilities. The system allows anonymous commenting with threaded replies and uses AI-powered semantic ordering to group similar comments while preserving thread integrity. All components will be contained within a `cloudflare_comments` folder for easy deployment and management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to post comments without creating an account, so that I can quickly share my thoughts on content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the comment form THEN the system SHALL display a name field and comment text area
2. WHEN a user submits a comment without entering a name THEN the system SHALL default the name to "Anonymous"
3. WHEN a user submits a comment with valid content THEN the system SHALL store it in Cloudflare D1 database
4. WHEN a comment is successfully posted THEN the system SHALL display it immediately in the comment section

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to reply to existing comments, so that I can engage in threaded discussions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views a comment THEN the system SHALL display a "Reply" button
2. WHEN a user clicks the reply button THEN the system SHALL show a reply form nested under the parent comment
3. WHEN a user submits a reply THEN the system SHALL store it as a child of the parent comment
4. WHEN displaying replies THEN the system SHALL maintain the thread hierarchy visually
5. WHEN displaying threads THEN the system SHALL preserve the original thread container structure

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to see comments ordered by topic similarity, so that I can easily find related discussions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comments are displayed THEN the system SHALL use AI embeddings or LLM analysis to determine topic similarity
2. WHEN ordering comments THEN the system SHALL group similar topics together while preserving individual thread integrity
3. WHEN a comment has replies THEN the system SHALL keep the entire thread together regardless of similarity ordering
4. WHEN using Cloudflare Vectorize THEN the system SHALL generate embeddings for comment content
5. IF using LLM analysis THEN the system SHALL categorize comments by subject matter

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all comment system components contained in one folder, so that I can easily deploy and manage the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the system THEN all files SHALL be contained within a `cloudflare_comments` folder
2. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL include Cloudflare Worker code, database schemas, and frontend assets
3. WHEN configuring the system THEN it SHALL use Cloudflare D1 for data persistence
4. WHEN the system processes requests THEN it SHALL handle all operations through Cloudflare Workers

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the comment system to load quickly and work reliably, so that my commenting experience is smooth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the comment system loads THEN it SHALL respond within 2 seconds under normal conditions
2. WHEN submitting a comment THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback on success or failure
3. WHEN the system encounters errors THEN it SHALL display user-friendly error messages
4. WHEN the database is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the failure
5. WHEN processing AI similarity analysis THEN it SHALL not block comment submission or display

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a content moderator, I want comprehensive spam filtering, so that the comment system remains clean and usable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a comment is submitted THEN the system SHALL validate content length (minimum 1 character, maximum 2000 characters)
2. WHEN a comment contains only whitespace THEN the system SHALL reject it
3. WHEN the same IP submits multiple comments rapidly THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting (max 5 comments per minute)
4. WHEN storing comments THEN the system SHALL sanitize HTML input to prevent XSS attacks
5. WHEN a comment contains suspicious patterns THEN the system SHALL flag it for review (excessive links, repeated text, common spam phrases)
6. WHEN using AI capabilities THEN the system SHALL analyze comment content for spam likelihood
7. WHEN a comment is flagged as potential spam THEN the system SHALL either block it or mark it as pending moderation
8. WHEN the same content is submitted multiple times THEN the system SHALL detect and prevent duplicate comments
