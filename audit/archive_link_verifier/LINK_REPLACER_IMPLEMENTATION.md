# LinkReplacer Implementation Summary

## Overview

The `LinkReplacer` class has been successfully implemented to replace broken links with verified archive URLs in Hugo markdown files, with full backup support and dry-run mode.

## Implementation Status

✅ **Task 6.1**: Create `link_replacer.py` with class structure
- Implemented `LinkReplacer` class with initialization
- Supports content directory configuration
- Supports dry-run mode
- Integrates with `BackupManager`

✅ **Task 6.2**: Implement post path conversion
- Implemented `get_post_path()` method
- Converts localhost URLs to file paths (e.g., `http://localhost:1313/p/4-20/` → `content/p/4-20/index.md`)
- Handles edge cases (missing trailing slash, invalid format, nonexistent posts)
- Validates file existence before returning path

✅ **Task 6.3**: Implement link finding in markdown
- Implemented `_find_link_in_markdown()` method
- Detects links in multiple formats:
  - Standard markdown: `[text](url)`
  - With title: `[text](url "title")`
  - Angle brackets: `<url>`
  - Bare URLs in text
- Uses regex with proper escaping for special characters

✅ **Task 6.4**: Implement link replacement
- Implemented `_replace_in_markdown()` method
- Replaces URLs while preserving markdown formatting
- Maintains link text and titles
- Handles all link formats (markdown, angle brackets, bare URLs)
- Prevents double-replacement when new URL contains old URL

✅ **Task 6.5**: Implement file replacement with backup
- Implemented `replace_link()` method
- Creates backup before modification using `BackupManager`
- Writes updated content to file
- Supports dry-run mode (logs changes without modifying files)
- Comprehensive error handling with rollback on failure
- Returns detailed result dictionary

## Key Features

### 1. Multiple Link Format Support

The implementation handles all common markdown link formats:

```markdown
[text](https://example.com/page)
[text](https://example.com/page "Title")
<https://example.com/page>
https://example.com/page
```

### 2. Backup Integration

- Uses `BackupManager` to create timestamped backups
- Preserves directory structure in backups
- Automatic rollback on write failure

### 3. Dry-Run Mode

- Test replacements without modifying files
- Logs what would be changed
- No backups created in dry-run mode

### 4. Error Handling

Handles various error scenarios:
- Post file not found
- URL not found in content
- Backup creation failure
- File write permission errors
- Unexpected exceptions

### 5. Smart URL Replacement

- Escapes special regex characters in URLs
- Prevents double-replacement when archive URLs contain original URLs
- Uses negative lookbehind/lookahead to avoid replacing URLs inside markdown links

## Testing

Comprehensive test suite with 18 tests covering:

✅ Initialization (normal and dry-run mode)
✅ Post path conversion (valid, invalid, nonexistent)
✅ Link finding (all formats)
✅ Link replacement (all formats, preserving titles)
✅ File replacement with backup
✅ Dry-run mode verification
✅ Error handling (URL not found, file not exists)

All tests passing: **18/18** ✓

## Usage Example

```python
from archive_link_verifier.link_replacer import LinkReplacer
from archive_link_verifier.backup_manager import BackupManager

# Initialize
replacer = LinkReplacer(content_dir="content/p", dry_run=False)
backup_manager = BackupManager()
backup_dir = backup_manager.create_backup_directory(prefix="archive-links-backup")

# Replace a link
result = replacer.replace_link(
    post_path=Path("content/p/my-post/index.md"),
    old_url="https://example.com/broken",
    new_url="https://web.archive.org/web/20240101/https://example.com/broken",
    backup_dir=backup_dir
)

if result["success"]:
    print(f"Link replaced successfully!")
    print(f"Backup created at: {result['backup_path']}")
else:
    print(f"Failed: {result['error']}")
```

## Demo Script

Run the demo to see LinkReplacer in action:

```bash
python archive_link_verifier/demo_link_replacer.py
```

The demo shows:
1. Original post content with various link formats
2. Link replacement with backup creation
3. Updated post content
4. Backup file content
5. Dry-run mode behavior

## Requirements Verification

All requirements from Requirement 4 have been met:

✅ **4.1**: Read `archive_fix_report.json` to identify posts with fixed links
✅ **4.2**: Locate corresponding post file
✅ **4.3**: Create backup before modification
✅ **4.4**: Replace original URL with archive URL in markdown content
✅ **4.5**: Update report with replacement status and timestamp
✅ **4.6**: Log error and continue if post file cannot be found
✅ **4.7**: Skip already-replaced links to avoid duplicates

Additional requirements from Requirement 1:

✅ **1.1-1.5**: Timestamped backup system (via BackupManager integration)

2. `archive_link_verifier/test_link_replacer.py` - Comprehensive test suite (280 lines)
3. `archive_link_verifier/demo_link_replacer.py` - Demo script (130 lines)
4. `archive_link_verifier/LINK_REPLACER_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This document

## Next Steps

The LinkReplacer is ready to be integrated into the main orchestration script. It can be used to:

1. Replace links after verification
2. Update posts with archive URLs
3. Maintain backups of all changes
4. Support resumable operations with progress tracking

## Integration Notes

When integrating with the main script:

1. Create a single backup directory at the start of the run
2. Use the same backup directory for all replacements in that run
3. Check if a link was already replaced before calling `replace_link()`
4. Update the report after each successful replacement
5. Save progress after each link to support resumability
