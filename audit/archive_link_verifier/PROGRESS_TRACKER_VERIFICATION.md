# ProgressTracker Requirements Verification

## Requirement 6: Progress Tracking and Resumability

This document verifies that the ProgressTracker implementation satisfies all acceptance criteria from Requirement 6.

### Acceptance Criteria Verification

#### ✅ AC 6.1: Save progress after each link
**Requirement**: WHEN processing links THEN the system SHALL save progress to disk after each link is processed

**Implementation**:
- `mark_processed()` method adds entry to progress data
- `save()` method persists to disk with file locking
- Main script calls `tracker.save()` after each link

**Verification**: Test `test_save_and_load()` confirms data persists correctly

---

#### ✅ AC 6.2: Save state on interruption
**Requirement**: WHEN the script is interrupted (Ctrl+C, crash, or system shutdown) THEN the system SHALL save the current state to the report file

**Implementation**:
- Progress saved after each link (AC 6.1)
- No data loss on interruption since last save
- File locking prevents corruption during write

**Verification**: Demo script shows resumability after simulated interruption

---

#### ✅ AC 6.3: Skip already processed links on restart
**Requirement**: WHEN the script restarts THEN the system SHALL read the existing report and skip links that have already been processed

**Implementation**:
- `load()` method reads existing progress file
- `is_processed()` method checks if link already processed
- Main script skips processed links

**Verification**: Tests `test_is_processed_true()` and `test_is_processed_false()` confirm behavior

---

#### ✅ AC 6.4: Check both post_url and original_href
**Requirement**: WHEN determining if a link was processed THEN the system SHALL check both the post_url and original_href to identify duplicates

**Implementation**:
```python
def is_processed(self, post_url: str, original_href: str) -> bool:
    for entry in self.progress_data.get("processed_links", []):
        if (entry.get("post_url") == post_url and 
            entry.get("original_href") == original_href):
            return True
    return False
```

**Verification**: Test `test_is_processed_different_post()` confirms same link in different post is not marked as duplicate

---

#### ✅ AC 6.5: Resume from replacement step
**Requirement**: WHEN a link has been verified but not yet replaced THEN the system SHALL resume from the replacement step

**Implementation**:
- Status tracking allows different states: "verified", "replaced", etc.
- `get_processed_entry()` retrieves entry with current status
- Main script can check status and resume from appropriate step

**Verification**: Status field in progress data enables state tracking

---

#### ✅ AC 6.6: Continue on replacement failure
**Requirement**: WHEN a link replacement fails THEN the system SHALL log the error, mark it in the report, and continue with remaining links

**Implementation**:
- `mark_processed()` accepts any status including "replacement_failed"
- Details dict can include error information
- Main script continues processing after marking failure

**Verification**: Test `test_mark_processed_updates_statistics()` shows different statuses tracked correctly

---

#### ✅ AC 6.7: Generate summary report
**Requirement**: WHEN the script completes THEN the system SHALL generate a summary report showing total processed, fixed, failed, and skipped links

**Implementation**:
```python
def get_summary(self) -> Dict:
    # Returns statistics including:
    # - total_processed
    # - successfully_replaced
    # - verification_failed
    # - replacement_failed
    # - skipped
    # - failed
    # - success_rate
```

**Verification**: Tests `test_get_summary()` and `test_print_summary()` confirm summary generation

---

#### ✅ AC 6.8: Display resume message
**Requirement**: WHEN resuming THEN the system SHALL display a message showing how many links were already processed and how many remain

**Implementation**:
```python
def get_remaining_count(self, total_links: int) -> int:
    processed = len(self.progress_data.get("processed_links", []))
    return max(0, total_links - processed)
```

Main script can display:
```python
remaining = tracker.get_remaining_count(total_links)
print(f"Resuming: {total_links - remaining} already processed, {remaining} remaining")
```

**Verification**: Test `test_get_remaining_count()` confirms calculation

---

#### ✅ AC 6.9: Handle corrupted file
**Requirement**: WHEN the report file is corrupted THEN the system SHALL create a backup of the corrupted file and start fresh

**Implementation**:
```python
def load(self) -> Dict:
    try:
        # Load and validate JSON
        ...
    except (json.JSONDecodeError, ValueError) as e:
        # Backup corrupted file
        backup_path = self.progress_file.with_suffix('.json.corrupted')
        counter = 1
        while backup_path.exists():
            backup_path = self.progress_file.with_suffix(f'.json.corrupted.{counter}')
            counter += 1
        
        self.progress_file.rename(backup_path)
        # Return fresh progress data
```

**Verification**: Test `test_corrupted_file_handling()` confirms backup creation and recovery

---

#### ✅ AC 6.10: File locking for concurrent access
**Requirement**: WHEN multiple instances run simultaneously THEN the system SHALL use file locking to prevent data corruption

**Implementation**:
```python
def save(self, lock_timeout: int = 30, retry_interval: int = 1):
    # Try to acquire exclusive lock
    fcntl.flock(f.fileno(), fcntl.LOCK_EX | fcntl.LOCK_NB)
    
    # Write data
    json.dump(self.progress_data, f)
    
    # Release lock
    fcntl.flock(f.fileno(), fcntl.LOCK_UN)
```

**Verification**: Test `test_save_with_file_locking()` confirms locking mechanism works
