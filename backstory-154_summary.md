# Podcast Summary

The podcast episode opens with host Harry Steele clarifying that while the World Health Organization officially ended the global health emergency for COVID-19 in May 2023, the pandemic remains active—continuing to claim lives every three minutes and posing threats through new variants. Millions suffer from long-term post-COVID effects, and thousands remain in intensive care. The U.S. has also ended vaccine proof requirements for non-U.S. travelers at land ports, marking a significant policy shift, though public health risks persist. The discussion then turns to Title 42, the emergency policy used to expel migrants to Mexico citing public health concerns. Though it ended in 2023, over 2.7 million people were expelled without proper asylum processes. Critics, including Democrats and health experts, argue the health justification was politically motivated, part of broader immigration restrictions. Biden inherited the policy but maintained it during record migrant arrests, delaying a transition to proper asylum hearings. The migrant crisis is framed as part of global patterns—people fleeing conflict and poverty, such as from Africa to Europe, risking their lives in the process.

The conversation shifts to historical connections, with Steele recalling his great-grandfather, George T. Burn, who served in the Rainbow Division (167th Infantry, Alabama Fourth). This unit gained a reputation as “ass kickers” for its combat experience during the Punitive Expedition against Pancho Villa in 1916, including raids and the burning of Columbus, New Mexico. Both Jack Pershing and Patton gained early combat experience there. The discussion then moves to modern geopolitical tensions, including Russia’s claimed drone attack on the Kremlin, widely seen as propaganda, and retaliatory air raids on Ukraine targeting cities like Kiev, Zaporizhia, and Odessa. In response, U.S. and Belgian forces are ramping up ammunition production—a detail recalled from Steele’s former job in Tuscaloosa during the Vietnam War, where a box company expanded from weekly orders to three factories and 100 workers producing military ammunition boxes.

The episode examines the troubling links between powerful figures and financial influence, citing the 2014 private calendar of Jeffrey Epstein, which lists meetings with high-profile individuals including CIA director William Burns, Bard College president Leon Potstein, and Obama White House counsel Katherine Rumler—all after Epstein’s 2008 conviction. The list underscores how wealth enables sustained access to power, with Harvard’s Martin Nowak, a major donor, among the linked figures. Steele expresses concern that despite Epstein’s convictions, accountability remains absent, and that such networks operate with minimal oversight. He questions whether intelligence agencies blackmailed Epstein to place agents in his network for operational cover, calling the lack of scrutiny “nuts.”

A misstatement is corrected: Noam Chomsky is 20 years older than previously suggested. The discussion then turns to financial instability, referencing the 2023 bank failures of PacWest and Western Alliance, and Colonial Bank from 2009, adjusted for inflation to highlight historical scale. The White House’s $140 million AI funding push is noted, with Vice President Kamala Harris commenting on automation replacing human labor. AI development is described as unfolding faster than expected, with the U.S. Navy planning to replace most manned fighters with AI-driven, unmanned aircraft within a decade—a shift seen as unsettling by some.

A separate lawsuit emerges over the Colt M1892 P320 pistol, with over 100 officers reporting accidental discharges, 80 injured in 2016, prompting safety warnings. A disturbing incident in New York involves a 30-year-old former Marine, who shouted “I want food. I'm not taking no for an answer,” before launching into an aggressive rant about hunger and jail. He was subdued by a 24-year-old subway rider who applied a 15-minute chokehold, despite the train stopping and doors opening. Vasquez criticizes the chokehold as untrained and unrealistic, noting that proper restraint training teaches gradual pressure release. He argues the incident reflects a failure in public health and safety protocols, given the man’s extreme and untrained behavior.

The conversation then turns to local governance issues in Alabama, including the Planning Commission’s denial of a six-lot subdivision for condos, a decision criticized as part of a recurring cycle of stalled development—“coming back to the troughs.” Concerns are raised over alleged evidence planting by Officer Kilgore in Center, Alabama, and a proposed county-wide chairman in Baldwin County, set to be installed by sheriff influence. David Brewer is named as the likely candidate, sparking backlash over potential unchecked power. The discussion also touches on the abandoned Bama Bayou property, now rebranded as Wharf Landing, and a lawsuit by the Bowen Bridge Company over new bridge construction allegedly violating a non-compete agreement. Though Alabama has no executive privilege law, the state’s transportation director claims confidential communications are protected.

In Fairhope, few outside City Hall are aware of local government operations. The governor proposed a $400 check for residents, initially approved by the Senate at 90%, but slashed to $105, costing $275 million in state funds and $5 million in distribution. The gap between the governor’s estimate and Senate analysis reveals a major budgeting disconnect. A proposed $30 million state-funded health care school in Maringo County was rejected by the Senate, citing lack of planning, and replaced with a $500,000 study. Critics express concern that rural areas like Livingston may lose access, with a Democrat arguing other regions would prefer hosting the school. The discussion briefly references 19th-century education reformer Horace Mann, who admired the Prussian model for shaping elite students, though the model’s limitations in America are noted—lacking a standardized curriculum, and failing to equip students with skills for industrial labor.

John D. Rockefeller saw this gap as a failure of the system and advocated for education that instilled work ethic and belief in work as a path to freedom—laying groundwork for future industrial education reforms. In Alabama, a new fentanyl trafficking bill reveals that law enforcement officers have been exposed to fentanyl during raids, with dealers intentionally laying the drug on $100 bills, knowing officers would handle them. The substance, potent and invisible, can cross skin lines, causing illness. Representative Matt Simpson proposed harsh penalties—up to life in prison for 10 pounds—while also introducing legislation to protect first responders exposed to fentanyl, classifying exposure-related illnesses as felonies (Class B if injured, Class A if fatal). A case in Mulligan County or Mobile involved a suspect carrying fentanyl in candy-colored pills, a setup designed to attract minors, and the speaker warns such a person would need a PR firm, not a lawyer.

A separate bill expands protection from abuse orders to include grandparents, grandchildren, and step-in parents, recently passed by the House. The law includes a 24-hour cooling-off period for individuals with domestic violence orders, aiming to prevent repeat offenses. Critics argue it fails to stop violent acts, citing the Daphne case where a man was released after threatening his grandparents and later killed them—because Alabama law does not classify grandparent violence as domestic abuse.

The episode details the firing of the University of Alabama’s baseball coach, following allegations of gambling ties. The Columbus Casino Commission cited cell phone recordings and email extensions as evidence of contact with the coach. A backup pitcher with a March 17 start was reportedly pulled, a move seen as suspicious by bettors, especially given Pete Rose’s known betting against his own team. An Ohio Casino Commission report confirmed the claims. The fired coach, Tucker, had agreed to speak at a nonprofit fundraiser in Oxford, Alabama, helping disabled adults gain job skills—though he did not know the firing would occur before the event.

Tucker reflects on his unexpected firing, noting he traveled to Oxford and spoke to audiences, boosting visibility for President Biden’s campaign. He praises Biden’s speech at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner as strong and humorous, though he missed the event. He expresses surprise at Robert Kennedy Jr.’s growing influence among Democrats, despite skepticism about his vaccine claims. He also notes a controversial Trump comment on a rape case was cut from the record, urging the team to find and review it for the next episode.

Tucker confirms he moved into the Trump Tower penthouse a year after its 1983 completion, remaining there until his presidential election. He notes the tower is at 57th and Fifth Avenue, while the Plaza Hotel at 59th and Fifth Avenue was owned for about five years, beginning in the early 1990s. During the 1980s and 1990s, he attended evening events like benefits and galas, often with Getty Images coverage. He recalls being the Grand Marshal of the 1995 Veterans Day Parade and making frequent TV appearances, including late-night shows and Sunday political segments. He admits to watching *Good Morning America* occasionally during that time.

He reflects on personal relationships, confirming appearances on the Today Show and limited exposure to Good Morning America. He recalls knowing Bob Wright, then NBC head, and befriending Roger Ailes. He was married to Ivana Trump from 1978 to the early 1990s, then to Marla Maples, though dates are unclear. He denies publicizing visits to Marla and confirms he almost never visited Bergdorf Goodman, with no specific shopping memories. He denies meeting E. Gene Carroll, dismissing her claim of encountering him there 23 years ago. On June 21, 2019, he responded publicly to Carroll’s allegations via a tweet, asserting, “I’ve never met this person in my life. She is trying to sell a new book that should indicate her motivation.” The tweet, posted by Laura Litvin, was later shared.

Trump confirms he made a June 24, 2019, statement to The Hill, saying, “She’s not my type” and “It never happened,” directly denying allegations involving E. Jean Carroll. He reaffirms the claims as “ridiculous and disgusting,” and notes that if the incident had occurred, it would have been reported immediately. He recalls a brief, unrelated handshaking moment during a charity event at Bergdorf Goodman, where he didn’t recognize the person, reinforcing his claim of no prior contact. He admits he didn’t know whether anyone working for him researched Carol before making the statements, and confirms he had no knowledge of her political party or political agenda. On June 24, he said she was “not my type,” referring to physical appearance after seeing a photo, adding he’d never married anyone who wasn’t his “type.” He later posted on TrueSocial under the handle “Real Donald Trump,” reiterating his stance.

On October 12, 2022, Trump posted a statement on TrueSocial and shared it with Truth and Post, calling the Bergdorf Goodman case a “complete con job” and criticizing the New York legal system as “a broken disgrace.” He dismissed the claim of meeting a woman at a department store as a hoax, noting during an Anderson Cooper interview promoting a “crummy book,” the woman’s story appeared inconsistent and fraudulent. He denies ever meeting E. Jean Carroll, calling her a “whack jab” and asserting he knows nothing about her beyond what he read in stories. He claims the allegation of a meeting and her “swooning” is false, and that the claim of sexual assault is a complete hoax—no event occurred. He calls it a “fake story” and “made up story,” referencing his prior use of the term “hoax” in over 250 instances in 2020. He lists specific instances he labels as hoaxes: the Russia hoax, Ukraine hoax, Mueller hoax, and the “lying to Congress” hoax—all of which he claims were debunked.

He asserts that claims of inappropriate behavior, including on an airplane, are false and that if such an event had occurred, he would remember the exact date and have complained to the airline. He points to a statement in the Laura Litvin tweet (DJT20), where he says the world should know what’s really going on and that people should pay dearly for false accusations—specifically naming E.G. Carroll and her attorneys. The episode ends with a casual farewell, as Harry and the host wrap up, emphasizing the importance of checking out a recent recommendation. The conversation briefly touches on family moments—grandkids at the door—before the host locks the door, signaling a shift in tone.
