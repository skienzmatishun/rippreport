The Alabama Ethics Commission has become the facilitator for corruption in the state, they now want to expand on their role. They want to change existing Ethics laws which would allow things, illegal today, to become legal, all because of the Mike Hubbard conviction.

These changes send us backwards and turn a blind eye to elected officials using their elected office for personal gain. What is sad is who the sponsors of these changes are.

Please read the article linked and the links in the article. The Ethics Commission has held no one in Baldwin County accountable, despite the fact that dozens of complaints have been filed through the years. If the changes suggested to the Ethics law are approved then filing a legitimate complaint will be moot.
