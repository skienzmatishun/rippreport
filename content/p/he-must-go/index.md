79.9 Million infected with SARS-COV-2 in the USA with 976,618 deaths.

Attorney General Steve Marshall appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee this week to object to the nomination of the President Joe Biden’s Nominee to the Supreme Court of the United States of America Ketanji Brown Jackson. And he got Will Smith’ed.

We take you in the way back machine and thank “The V Team” for the Content from 2018 “Where is Steve Marshall” where they chronicle his rise from mediocrity in the Democratic Party after his mentor Don Siegleman “took the stripes”. Now he is the hatchet man for his real constituency: whoever is giving money to the Republican Attorney General’s Association POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEE. Think of it like Baldwin County Sewer Service and it’s principals being subject to yet another Civil Jury Verdict, this time for Fraud related to the “Million Dollars Swimming Pool” at the Ballaton Subdivision; so how come there hasn’t been not one criminal inquiries? Because of who is funding local campaigns.

A million dollar fraud case and no cuffs. The Sheriff, The DA, The US Attorney for the Southern District of Alabama, Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall? No not a one. The Baldwin County Republican Party held an event Thursday night at the Daphne Civic Center. Sheriff David Clark, the guy with the Cowboy hat from Minnesota, was the keynote speaker at the Back The Blue Dinner. Pam and I enjoyed the fellowship and the food, props to Alex.

There are also numerous activities that we attempted to make on the campaign trail. The Elberta Sausage Festival, the Cajun Cookoff in Mobile, and the Rattlesnake Rodeo in Opp, complete with the “timber rattler” Mo Brooks. As the war continues in Ukraine, President Biden stated, “He Must Go”. Then the Whitehouse Staff milley-mouthed-it and said it was not a call for regime change.

SCOTUS Justice Clarence Thomas is under fire for communications between his wife and the Trump Chief of Staff post election leading up to the events of Jan 6th. And the Ghost of Sheriff James Hayes comes back to haunt the taxpayers of Etowah County, this week the US Marshall Service stated that it will no longer use the facility to house ICE prisoners, citing numerous problems over many years. The Etowah County Commission must still paying for the facility which was overbuilt specifically to house said Federal Detainees.
