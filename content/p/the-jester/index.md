The Jester is back and now he wants to give away 106 acres of municipal land to Weeks Bay. The very same Jester who used his elected position for personal gain by securing the Fairhope Art Center Contract. The same Jester who favored the Fly Creek Apartments and it’s developer over his constituents.

The Fairhope Jester supports the Kant-Corte Apartments on Fly Creek, at the same time he is building his own home on Fly Creek. Surely you jest! The Jester supports the developer…

The same Jester is 100% behind the conservation easement.

The Fairhope City Council and Weeks Bay are trying to tell the general public that a Conservation Easement does not mean Weeks Bay owns the property. True they also have no lease or title to the land.

Beware the Jester is laughing at you.
