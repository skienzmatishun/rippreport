The Jester is back and now he wants to give away 106 acres of municipal land to Weeks Bay. The very same Jester who used his elected position for personal gain by securing the Fairhope Art Center Contract. The same Jester who favored the Fly Creek Apartments and it’s developer over his constituents.

The same Jester is 100% behind the conservation easement.

Beware the Jester is laughing at you.
