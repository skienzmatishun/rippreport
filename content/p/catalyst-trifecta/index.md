## CATALYST TRIFECTA

Catalyst is based out of Fairhope and they are still reeling from losing the Mayor’s election in Fairhope. Catalyst is quite simply a good ole boys club for the entitled, corrupt politicians and the many business that feed off the tax payer. Catalyst is responsible for the obstruction of Fairhope Government and the personal assaults on the Mayor. Their day is coming.

Catalyst candidates are bought and paid for and expected once in office to swear alliance to the Catalyst club.

CATALYST CANDIDATE Chris Elliott running against David Northcutt, has hit the political panic button. CATALYST has called out their silent members to raise their heads in support of the Catalyst Trifecta. Eddie Tyler, Superintendent of Schools, Hoss Mack, Sheriff, Gulf Shores Mayor Craft and Orange Beach Mayor Tony Kennon. Jeff Boyd and Cecil Christenberry also have mud on their shoes.

They all have one thing in common, Elliott OWES them and Montgomery has his testicles. Elliott, The Tax Man, has a 12% gas tax coming your way, if elected, to pay for two bridges.

Elliott has raised 500,000 dollars in his campaign and the figure could go as high as 700,000 for a job that pays 42,000. That should be reason enough NOT to vote for him.

David Northcutt is the people’s choice and has not sold out to Catalyst.

CATALYST CANDIDATE MILLIONAIRE Tucker Dorsey may be the most disliked politician in Baldwin County. County employees are praying every night that they will be rid of him once and for all. When Mr Dorsey was elected he could hardly rub two dimes together, today he is reported to be a millionaire. His slick mail box ads have him standing under a lemon tree, what a subliminal message. He has been a lemon on the County Commission and has used his political position to further his own pocketbook.

PLEASE VOTE BILLIE JO UNDERWOOD, She is not a lemon.

Please, this is a Judge that needs to be kicked to the curb. You will be preforming a public service to Not vote for her. If you, or your children, have been a victim of this, so called Judge, do your best to use social media or whatever means possible to let other victims know that now is their opportunity to flush her away with Elliott and Dorsey.

Alabama has a proud legal system ripe with attorneys who plan a career as a judge. In Baldwin and Mobile Counties, there is a specified gateway to the sought-after bench. It is called an appointment.
