Fairhope City Councilman Robert Brown has been defending his contract with the Eastern Shore Art Center since the publication of:

Hey Robert please post those “other” bids, our information, is that no other bids exist. Please also include the Ethics Letter that gave you permission, as a ESAC Board member and Liaison to the City Council, to use your office for personal gain.

The last Fairhope City Council meeting should prove to everyone that this “Catalyst” Council is not going to listen to their constituents, they are benefiting, with an insurance package…

The rest of the City Council has remained mute and allowed Councilman Brown to use his elected office for personal gain. In fact the whole Council just voted for full family insurance, no other part time employees have the same. That insurance is worth around $17,000 a year, sounds like personal gain! They are just as guilty. This is the worst, City Council, Fairhope has ever elected to office. Please use those same election powers and run for office, in 2020, and vote this Catalyst Council out of office. Your property values and quality of life are at stake.

Councilman Brown’s defense rests entirely on him calling others CRAZY?
