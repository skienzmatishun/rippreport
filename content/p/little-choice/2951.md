 Well, regarding the candidates that we have running for Alabama US Senate, I really don't know much about any of them. However, I do know that Trip Pittman and Pittman Tractor had no right to get the Boom contract to begin with. I also would have thought that Pittman would have gone out of his way to do a stellar first class job.  Instead he did a half$$$ job and got paid in full for doing a terrible job and not even pulling up the anchors instead of leaving them in the bay to continue polluting our waterways. Of course Kant was involved with this so he was just as much to blame. Don't know who I'm voting for but, I know that I'm not voting for Trip Pittman of Pittman Tractor who screwed us and did a terrible job on the Boom but has also taken equipment contract away from other local equipment companies that deserve them just as much by using his political powers as much as he deemed necessary. So long Pittman.
