 If it's true that both Trip Pittman and Jack Burrell both attend Fairhope Methodist Church. I now know where the term "Fleecing the Flock" came from. We have given sooo much to that Church and have received so much in return. I hope that if they really attend this church that they will both start praying and stop taking advantage of this church and  most of all,  God himself!!!!!
