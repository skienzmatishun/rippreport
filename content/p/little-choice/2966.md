 I'm not sure. I have the highest regards for the Church and most of its members. I think some of them are in a trance and think Pittman and Burrell are heroes. They need to snap out of it. Pittman and Burrell are the devils of the Church and need to be cast out upon their assess.  Hate to see it happen at a church that so many different people go there for lots of different things and it's great. Though people are beginning to see the light. They won't come out and publicly endorse Pittman and Burrell is next. Have Faith. God has started turning the tides and we as a community will soon finally reap the benefits and not Pittman and Burrell with all the money they are sticking in their pockets.
