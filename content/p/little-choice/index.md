## Special Election | Alabama | Swamp Drainers PAC

On the Republican side, we have Luther Strange, who now faces multiple ethics complaints. He allowed the Luv Gov a pass and also turned a blind eye to Sen. Pittman's actions as “appointed Trustee” of BP Funds. Pittman walked with $750,000 in his pocket while other accused of far less crimes we prosecuted.

Infamous Judge Roy Moore: The Alabama Court of the Judiciary on Sept. 30, 2016 suspended Moore for the remainder of his term as chief justice after finding him guilty of six charges of violation of the canons of judicial ethics. The only Supreme Court Justice thrown off the bench, TWICE, in the US. Send him to the swamp?

Congressman Mo Brooks: Not as bad as Luther or Moore but a career politician who lives in the swamp.

## Brooks: If Sessions fired, I'll give up seat - CNN Video

Sen Trip Pittman:

The first three selections are a NO, Pittman is a HELL NO, He is the WORST elected official in Baldwin County, by a long shot. He believes in term limits and also fleecing his constituents.

## Fairhope ends contract with Senate candidate’s company - Lagniappe Mobile

The Fairhope City Council Monday voted to award its conditional disaster debris removal and disposal contract to the lowest responsive and responsible vendor — D&J Enterprises Inc., of Auburn — effectively ending an arrangement the city had since 2012 with State Sen. Trip Pittman, who chose not to seek another term in the Legislature this …

When it comes to compassion he has none, but he’s a “Christian”.

## Pittman holds back autism bill, threatening session

If you endorse political corruption then Pittman is your tool.

The only other person who is active in the race on the republican side is Dr. Randy Brinson:

Are you not tired of the same old BS from career politicians or politicians that use their office for personal gain, like Pittman? Well your alternative may be Mr Brinson. He may not be well known and certainly is not a career politician but would be a breath of fresh air compared to the above.

Please vote in the primary and think carefully who you want as Alabama’s next US Senator. Be careful you do not send a swamp rat to the swamp.
