 I certainly agree with you about enough Trip Pittmam. Which will happen and concentrate on our infrastructure. Maybe that will be a upcoming subject. However, I'm pleased to see so many people who are sticking with the subject and it's been such a pleasure not having the fools who were distracting and make no sense. I even heard that some of them have had people who have said they were proud of Jester and Truth Teller and those people can now do their own thing. Hopefully in another city. We have had enough of fools and I applaud putting them in their place. Next Subject please!
