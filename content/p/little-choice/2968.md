 I'll be glad to have the first primary vote done so everyone can quit fixating on Pittman -who will not make the cut- and worry about our local situation. My idea about the possibility of attacking all of our major infrastructure needs at once seems pretty good to me given the last east sewage mess.  People need to make bold moves to get ahead of the infrastructure mess. It has been building for a long time and the chickens will be coming home to roost sooner rather than later
