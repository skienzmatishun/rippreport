 Fairhope better wake up! Burrell and Boone have made some shiny coin on the citizen's dime...the sewerage plant "overhaul" was a haul alright...$13 million for what? 

NO ONE KNOWS. Meanwhile, every week they dump hundreds of thousands of gallons of untreated human waste into Mobile Bay. 

THIS IS FAIRHOPE.  Read it and weep boys and girls. You get the gubment you deserve!
You can't sip your wine and sniff your farts all day long...but Fairhope is no better
than those millions of turds floating in Mobile Bay.

Time to audit the books and find out how much damage the goobs have caused. Build a new plant away from the bay! Be civilized and do the right thing--for once!!

It is so disgusting! Fairhope is a disgrace!!! Lying, cheating filthy bastards.
