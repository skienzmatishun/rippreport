Think you do not need zoning then read this article. Un-zoned properties are just what these developers are looking for and they do not give a damn how THEIR development affects your quality of life.

The African American community, in the proposed district 8, is jammed between RSA development, that soon will border Thomason Hall Road, and Fairhope. The choice is annexing into Fairhope or establishing a zoning district. Without doing either you may wake up one day to a gas station or storage buildings with barb wire fencing, next door. Zoning is the way to go annexing into Fairhope is a poor option. District 8 extends as far down as hwy 32 bordered by hwy 13, see map. Many subdivisions are included in the district.

District 37 involves Lawrence Road, a beautiful mix of farm land and large lots. “What is District 37? This area is NOT in city limits but is within the 5 mile line extending from Fairhope's outer City Limits. We are on county land but NOT zoned. That means we are the "wild west" for developers and any one piece of land that is sold is only regulated by planning guidelines and not the wishes of neighboring property owners. Also, since we are within 5 miles of city limits that means the decisions are up to Fairhope City Council. A place we have no representation. I am looking to change that by proposing we become county zoned. “ Elizabeth Gabel Wilso

Check out the proposed districts, go to their sites and educated yourself on the pro’s and con’s of zoning.
