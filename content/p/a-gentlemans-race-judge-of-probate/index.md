Judge Tim Russell is being “aged out” of the position of Probate Judge. He retires with a stellar reputation and sets the bar high for his successor. Judge of Probate for Baldwin County is a very important position which generated 40 million dollars in 2017. It is not required that the position be filled by an attorney, fact is, it would be best that is was NOT an attorney. There are five candidates, and they have been gentlemen and civil among themselves, so far.

The Probate Judge is a peoples Judge who interacts with the public more often than most judicial Judges. The position has a 3.9 million dollar budget and manages approximately 60 employees, with four separate offices.

The position involves hiring law firms for various probate issues. Electing an attorney to Probate Judge who is going to be responsible for hiring other attorneys, especially in Baldwin County, has got to create problems.

The first to step into the Probate judge race was Randy Davis.

When Randy Davis went for the exit door, the good ole boys called on Catalyst and Judge Reid for a replacement, they tapped Lynn Perry.

The five candidates Max Hansen, Alan Lipscomb, Matt McKenzie, Catalyst Candidate Lynn Perry and “little’ Harry D’Olive, have four weeks to go before primary elections.

The top two will face each other in a run off July 17th.

Two recent polls, one Catalyst, has Max Hansen in the lead and far ahead of Catalyst candidate Perry. Catalyst is desperate to capture the Probate judge position and has started lobbing the other candidates, that do not make the runoff, to swing their support to Catalyst. Fat chance, what candidate that ran on a non-catalyst position would switch to Catalyst?

Max Hansen:

Max is a businessman, not an attorney, definitely a plus. A veteran and business owner since 1990. He has worked with the District Attorneys office, Daphne police and Sheriffs office. An interesting fact is the number of attorney’s, judges, law enforcement and fans of Tim Russel who are supporting him.

Alan Lipscomb, an attorney who’s law firm has concentrated on probate issues is also involved involved in numerous charitable organizations.

Alan is running neck to neck with Matt McKenzie, NOT an attorney.

Matt served 5 and half years in the United States Marine Corp and has dedicated his life to law enforcement. Baldwin County needs a “Few Good Men.” Semper Fi oorah.

Catalyst Candidate Lynn Perry:

Catalyst candidate, strike one, Lynn Perry, an attorney, strike two is running forth and gaining on McKenzie and Lipscomb. Mr. Perry has not been known to be related to the good ole boys of Catalyst in the past and some believe he is guilty by association only. Mr Perry has yet to record any qualification fee, $2587.13, since Feb. of this year, strike three. Catalyst must be asleep at the wheel because they know the qualification fee is an expense that must be recorded. The Ripp Report double checked this with the Alabama State Dept. and the confirmed no qualification fee has been listed. Catalyst is pounding on the back door trying to swing other candidates to Perry’s aid, however no one wants to be associated with Catalyst.

“little” Harry D’Olive is bring up the rear but do not count him out, he won’t be last.
