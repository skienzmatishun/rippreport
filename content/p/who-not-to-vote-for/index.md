Mid term elections are 18 months away and already we are seeing the GOB "good ole boys", and Catalyst, placing their candidates in strategic elected positions.

{{< socialpreview url="https://www.lagniappemobile.com/archives/campaign-callouts/article_bec12438-89d3-5432-87c5-83d05531c040.html" >}}

The selection of Jeff Sessions for U. S. Attorney General started a ball rolling for career politicians. State senator and Bible study partner of Jack Burrell, Tripp Pittman first announced that he would not be seeking re-election for state senate. His reason was that he believed in term limits, and God, so he decided to run for Mr. Sessions U. S. Senate seat. This is called good ole Alabama logic coming from a politician who has filled his pockets with BP cash and used his elected office to personally enrich himself during a catastrophe.

Sen. Pittman wants you to forget all of the above and now vote him in to a higher level of corruption.

WHO NOT TO VOTE FOR

Selected to run for Sen. Pittman’s State Senate seat is Baldwin County Commissioner Chris Elliott.

Elliott who was appointed to the commission.

You may remember Mr. Elliott’s run in with the law.

Commissioner Elliott then glossed over his previous comments and the serious charge of DUI.

Now Mr Elliott want us to elect him to a State Senate seat.

> “Commissioner Elliott is President and Owner of The Elliott Companies, Inc. which owns and operates Service Master Restore franchises in Mobile and Baldwin County, Alabama, providing multidisciplinary disaster mitigation, catastrophe restoration, and construction services.“

Sounds like Mr Elliott and Pittman have a lot in common. Wonder if Elliott is in the prayer group and exactly what do they pray for?

WHO NOT TO VOTE FOR

We need a challenger for both races that is not connected to Catalyst the GOBs or an incumbent climbing the ladder. Choices will be available, stay tuned.
