He has done it again. The Ripp Report has predicted numerous times that Ronan McSharry would continue his intoxication fueled assaults on women. The Paula DiNardi case ended up being an example of just how bad the municipal court and the municipal attorney are in Fairhope. Mr McSharry has assaulted yet another woman, racking up his ninth arrest, all involving alcohol.

This would not have happened except for the failing of the city attorney, Marcus McDowell. It should also be noted councilman Jack Burrell is best friends of McSharry. The city council did nothing. I do hope the latest victim realizes the failings of the municipal attorney Marcus McDowell. She needs additional council and should sue the city for allowing McSharry’s to continue his drunken rages against women and the city’s responsibility and it’s incompetence in the DiNardi case.

In the last 6 months Mr.McSharry has been involved in several incidents where he has been the subject of a public disturbance. The incidents did not rise to the level of assault, however clearly shows a pattern of his drunken behavior.

So what does the public due with a PUBLIC MENACE, when the police are doing their job. The council and Mayor ignored the situation and the municipal attorney fails to do his job?

BOYCOTT McSHARRY’S BAR

Why would you support a business that is owned by a serial domestic abuser? Why would you take your wife or girlfriend, female relative, any woman, to a business owned by such a person?

Every citizen in Fairhope should read these articles:

“Meanwhile, DiNardi filed a civil suit against McSharry in Circuit Court, claiming injury from being shoved from the stool. But the case took a soap opera-like turn as Stankoski allowed McSharry’s attorney to pursue a theory that his client was the victim of a political conspiracy that involved then-Mayor Karin Wilson and local media, including this newspaper. Stankoski even allowed McSharry’s attorney, James Pittman, to subpoena any potential communications between Lagniappe, Wilson, “consumer advocate” Paul Ripp and attorney Harry Still, despite state and federal shield laws protecting newspapers from such actions.

Despite pleading guilty, McSharry then appealed those convictions to Baldwin County Circuit Court, where Judge Clark Stankoski determined that Fairhope City Prosecutor Marcus McDowell had made an error on the charging document by failing to include the fact that McSharry “did cause physical harm to another person,” and voided the conviction.”

Be sure to watch the video and watch the city attorney lie to everyone in attendance of the council meeting.

“After the bully council is lectured about their treatment of women, Councilman Boone, aka llc. Boone, starts yelling at the Mayor and demanding Councilman Burrell immediately adjourn the meeting, which he did. Burrell cut off the Mayor’s comments after he had just pledged to her “she would be given the opportunity to speak.”

“The case was raised during public participation last night by Fairhope citizen Paul Ripp, who cited McSharry’s lengthy police record in the city of Fairhope. Ripp called McSharry a “public nuisance” and said he’s advocated for three alleged victims of McSharry over the past 10 years.

Speaking directly to McDowell, Ripp said he “finds it interesting” the prosecutor allowed the assault charge to be dismissed on appeal when he alleged only the assault charge, not the public intoxication charge, could threaten McSharry’s state-issued liquor license.”

“McSharry, the owner of McSharry’s Irish Pub, was on probation at the time. Roughly two months earlier, he pleaded guilty to “breach of peace,” a charge stemming from his alleged harassment of artist Nall Hollis. Hollis’ gallery is across the street from McSharry’s bar, and McSharry was accused of directing “abusive, offensive and or vulgar language and/or gestures toward Mr. Hollis” on March 19, 2017. His sentence in that case was 12 months of probation, with an order to have no contact with Hollis and to have “no distilled liquors and shall not become inebriated.”

“McSharry has been free to continue his business while his attorneys try to blame everyone for McSharry’s actions. McSharry is not an American citizen, he is a green card holder from Ireland.

A Green Card holder with an extensive police record that has a liquor license. WTH”

“Now let’s cut to the chase, Ripp Report style, McDowell is a holdover from the Mayor Can’t era. Captain Jack and the Council selected McDowell to carry their water and help pave the way to a Catalyst overthrowing the present Fairhope Government, in 2020. Capt Jack or Sherry Sullivan may be the Catalyst choice for Mayor but McDowell will be secure in his job as the Catalyst City Attorney.”

The Fairhope Police did their job. They arrested Mr McSharry 9 times. The failure is the municipal attorney and municipal court.

HE WILL DO IT AGAIN
