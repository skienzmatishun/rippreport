He has done it again. The Ripp Report has predicted numerous times that Ronan McSharry would continue his intoxication fueled assaults on women. The Paula DiNardi case ended up being an example of just how bad the municipal court and the municipal attorney are in Fairhope. Mr McSharry has assaulted yet another woman, racking up his ninth arrest, all involving alcohol.

This would not have happened except for the failing of the city attorney, Marcus McDowell. It should also be noted councilman Jack Burrell is best friends of McSharry. The city council did nothing. I do hope the latest victim realizes the failings of the municipal attorney Marcus McDowell. She needs additional council and should sue the city for allowing McSharry‚Äôs to continue his drunken rages against women and the city‚Äôs responsibility and it‚Äôs incompetence in the DiNardi case.

In the last 6 months Mr.McSharry has been involved in several incidents where he has been the subject of a public disturbance. The incidents did not rise to the level of assault, however clearly shows a pattern of his drunken behavior.

So what does the public due with a PUBLIC MENACE, when the police are doing their job. The council and Mayor ignored the situation and the municipal attorney fails to do his job?

BOYCOTT McSHARRY‚ÄôS BAR

Why would you support a business that is owned by a serial domestic abuser? Why would you take your wife or girlfriend, female relative, any woman, to a business owned by such a person?

Every citizen in Fairhope should read these articles:

‚ÄúMeanwhile, DiNardi filed a civil suit against McSharry in Circuit Court, claiming injury from being shoved from the stool. But the case took a soap opera-like turn as Stankoski allowed McSharry‚Äôs attorney to pursue a theory that his client was the victim of a political conspiracy that involved then-Mayor Karin Wilson and local media, including this newspaper. Stankoski even allowed McSharry‚Äôs attorney, James Pittman, to subpoena any potential communications between Lagniappe, Wilson, ‚Äúconsumer advocate‚Äù Paul Ripp and attorney Harry Still, despite state and federal shield laws protecting newspapers from such actions.

Despite pleading guilty, McSharry then appealed those convictions to Baldwin County Circuit Court, where Judge Clark Stankoski determined that Fairhope City Prosecutor Marcus McDowell had made an error on the charging document by failing to include the fact that McSharry ‚Äúdid cause physical harm to another person,‚Äù and voided the conviction.‚Äù

Be sure to watch the video and watch the city attorney lie to everyone in attendance of the council meeting.

‚ÄúAfter the bully council is lectured about their treatment of women, Councilman Boone, aka llc. Boone, starts yelling at the Mayor and demanding Councilman Burrell immediately adjourn the meeting, which he did. Burrell cut off the Mayor‚Äôs comments after he had just pledged to her ‚Äúshe would be given the opportunity to speak.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe case was raised during public participation last night by Fairhope citizen Paul Ripp, who cited McSharry‚Äôs lengthy police record in the city of Fairhope. Ripp called McSharry a ‚Äúpublic nuisance‚Äù and said he‚Äôs advocated for three alleged victims of McSharry over the past 10 years.

Speaking directly to McDowell, Ripp said he ‚Äúfinds it interesting‚Äù the prosecutor allowed the assault charge to be dismissed on appeal when he alleged only the assault charge, not the public intoxication charge, could threaten McSharry‚Äôs state-issued liquor license.‚Äù

‚ÄúMcSharry, the owner of McSharry‚Äôs Irish Pub, was on probation at the time. Roughly two months earlier, he pleaded guilty to ‚Äúbreach of peace,‚Äù a charge stemming from his alleged harassment of artist Nall Hollis. Hollis‚Äô gallery is across the street from McSharry‚Äôs bar, and McSharry was accused of directing ‚Äúabusive, offensive and or vulgar language and/or gestures toward Mr. Hollis‚Äù on March 19, 2017. His sentence in that case was 12 months of probation, with an order to have no contact with Hollis and to have ‚Äúno distilled liquors and shall not become inebriated.‚Äù

‚ÄúMcSharry has been free to continue his business while his attorneys try to blame everyone for McSharry‚Äôs actions. McSharry is not an American citizen, he is a green card holder from Ireland.

A Green Card holder with an extensive police record that has a liquor license. WTH‚Äù

‚ÄúNow let‚Äôs cut to the chase, Ripp Report style, McDowell is a holdover from the Mayor Can‚Äôt era. Captain Jack and the Council selected McDowell to carry their water and help pave the way to a Catalyst overthrowing the present Fairhope Government, in 2020. Capt Jack or Sherry Sullivan may be the Catalyst choice for Mayor but McDowell will be secure in his job as the Catalyst City Attorney.‚Äù

The Fairhope Police did their job. They arrested Mr McSharry 9 times. The failure is the municipal attorney and municipal court.

BOYCOTT McSHARRY‚Äôs

HE WILL DO IT AGAIN
