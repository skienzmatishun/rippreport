 I read the Ripp Report religiously and have agreed with most all of it, but tonight listening to local news was my turning point for the City o Fsirhope. . The story on local news had to do with our Mayor extending an olive branch. This should never have been on the news. It is also in my opinion too little too late.  I supported the Mayor but for me the tide has turned. I think the current Mayor and Council need to go NOW!!! This is unfortunate because I really did think Council Conyers was sincere.  I think the Mayor got caught up in being in the limelight and lost sight of what she was there to do....help run and take care of the city of Fsirhope. This battle between Council and Mayor is so destructive to this town and accomplishes nothing!  This cannot go on for 4 years!   Give us back our town!
