 Council as a whole wanted the Hatch project forced down our throats.  Lee Lawson was pushing this to support a handful of people. He is not thinking about what is best for Fairhope...just something to add to his resume. This project was done behind closed doors with council and Lee.  None cared about public input and still don't! I'm relieved to see the direction it's taking now. Arts and Culture.
