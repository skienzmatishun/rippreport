 Just because something is old doesn't necessarily make it historic.  This continuing nonsensical dialog regarding the old K-1 center has gone on for decades.  It's a special purpose property that should have been demolished 30 years ago.  My father owned the old nursing home next door from 1971 to 1979, which should also have been demolished decades ago.  I believe that Fairhope could have come up with an idea or two to make better use of this prime area for our beautiful town.  But sadly, people will keep fussing about the K-1 center and we'll have to keep looking at it.
