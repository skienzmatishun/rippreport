My first visit to the Veterans Hospital in Birmingham Alabama was in December of 1968, 51 years ago. Since that time I have had 14 shoulder operations and a kidney removed as a result of my tour of duty as a young Marine in Vietnam.

Today I report to the same hospital for my 15th operation, a complete reverse left shoulder replacement. Believe it or not I was one of the lucky ones. You only have to spend a few hours in a VA Hospital to be humbled.

In March of 1968, during the Tet Offensive, I was a Marine combat engineer stationed in Dong Ha, Vietnam, not far from the DMZ. Our base was hit so often that “incoming” was something you heard every day. One day I was the one to yell “incoming”. Later I would learn that an incoming North Vietnamese rocket just barely overshot our location and hit an ammo dump. The secondary explosion was far worse than the initial blast.

I went for the ground but did not quite make it when the concussion from the blast reached by body. My combat buddies told me I was thrown about the length of a foot ball field, landing against a bunker twisted like a pretzel They thought I was dead, I did too, however it turned out to be a severe body concussion.

Next thing I know I am in an underground Air Force field hospital in Dong Ha. I woke up to total confusion, my ears ringing so loud I could hardly hear, yelling and crying took up the oxygen in the room. It took a while for me to come around and realize that I had all my body parts. In the hospital next to me a Marine lost his arm. The Marine on the other stretcher had multiple shrapnel wounds. All I wanted at that time was to leave, outside I passed several body bags.

I made one of the biggest mistakes of my life that day by refusing the Purple Heart. No way could I fill out those papers after what I had seen in that hospital. That mistake however resulted in a Veterans Claim that has lasted 51 years and still pending.

I share this story with you so you may understand my passion for the Constitution of the United States and good government. I am just as passionate about exposing political corruption, the silent tax.

In 2010 I was classified 100% disabled. That same year I decided that I would form the Ripp Report as a non profit consumer organization focusing on political corruption, specifically Fairhope, where corruption was the oil for the machine.

For over 10 years The Ripp Report has been reporting on Fairhope politics, recently we have begun to cover Baldwin County.

Fairhope with all it’s pretty flowers has a very dark secret, political corruption. Those smelling the flowers and drinking the wine in Fairhope are ignorant of corruption, that ignorance has cost taxpayers millions.

The current City Council who appoints the Municipal Judge and the Municipal Attorney are ALL as corrupt as a three dollar bill. They pretend to be your friends and public servants all the while fleecing the taxpayers for personal gain. Everyone of these thieves has used their office for personal gain.

Elect a new City Council and they will appoint a new Judge and Municipal attorney.

Mayor Wilson, a public servant, has been the stumbling block that has prevented the overthrow of Fairhope government. In 2020, CATALYST, the good ole boys plan on using every means possible to gain control of Fairhope City Hall. If they are successful, say goodbye to Fairhope and your property values.

They better be ready for COMBAT.

The Ripp Report, Baldwin County Legal Eagle, and Backstory Podcast is going to do everything possible to expose these crooks for what they are. Fairhope needs public servant candidates for City Council. Please consider running for office or support new candidates. Fairhope fate is on the line.

Well it is time to go check into the hospital, it may take me a while to recover but I will be ready for COMBAT in 2020, will you?
