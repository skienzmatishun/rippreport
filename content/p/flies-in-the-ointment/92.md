 Mr. Ripp,
These "Flies" of which you speak are not true Republicans as they are opportunists.  These people have come down here to this county to make money and NOT to serve the people.  They only are looking at the next office in which they run and see this county as a career ladder with us as rungs that they step on while they climb there way up.
They will tell you they are "Conservative Christians" only because this is what their political consultants say this saying "polls well."  I challenge anyone to ask these "Flies" what a conservative is.  They have hijacked the Republican Party to use for THEIR gain.
