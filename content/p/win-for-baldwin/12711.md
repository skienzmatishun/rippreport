 Hey New Day,
You must really have an adverse opinion of the real estate people.  I say build, baby build.  Take the farmland and cover it with houses and driveways.  Overfill the schools, crowd the roads, bring in crime, and pay more taxes.
Everybody in the state of Alabama knows that Baldwin and Shelby Counties are honeypots for the state government.  They are full of people that have moved in from out of state just waiting to be taxed and governed.
