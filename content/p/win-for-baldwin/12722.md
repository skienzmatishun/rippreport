 I donot think that Burrell is that scared but if he goes after Fairhope residents for using their own water when the Council wants to give it to people who live outside of Fairhope then they would have reason to be scared 
Mr Burrell, please donot deny Fairhope residents their own water so you can give it to outside developers.  Just because they support your campaign does not mean you owe them our water
