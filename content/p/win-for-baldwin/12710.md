 So Matt beat Carey the Catalyst? 
Hey Carey, I would have voted for you but seeing you sold your soul to Catalyst, I just couldn’t
You tried to use your military background to push you over the mark but the Catalyst branding pulled you back
To all future politicians:  If you use Catalyst, SCB, or whatever  name the developers call themselves to get elected, you WILL be found out.  You can delay your payments to Catalyst so you won’t show it on your election forms, but we will know by the donations made to you.
Go ahead and say “Christian conservative.”   We will see through your hypocracy, greed, and  butt-kissing to outside developers
We will get  impact fees on your trashy subdivisions too
