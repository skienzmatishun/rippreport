Attorney General Steve Marshall filed a five-page motion in Montgomery Circuit Court on behalf of the Mabel Amos Trust, naming Thomas A. Albritton, John Bell of Regents Bank, and Rick Clifton as defendants. The motion alleges self-dealing, breach of fiduciary duty, and prohibited grants—specifically, private benefits from trust improvements—violating Alabama Code §19-3B-110, which grants the AG qualified beneficiary status. Marshall’s suit follows prior cases: Tommy Gai and Harry Mitchell (Connect the County), both representing school children. The speaker predicts all defendants will be removed and forced to repay funds, with a surprise revelation expected when trust beneficiaries are disclosed.  

Tom Albritton, born 1967 in Andalusia, grew up in an Alabama family with deep roots—parents and grandfather all attended the University of Alabama. After graduating from Marion Military Institute, he chose Alabama over other schools due to family ties and passion for football. He remained in Tuscaloosa, joining the Student Government Association and earning honors including Phi Beta Kappa and Jason’s. He was part of the "machine" culture, distinct from Auburn’s "spades" and fraternities.  

The speaker discovered the Mabel Amos Trust’s $100 million oil and gas wealth in 2010 after tracing it through a relative’s obituary, identifying Megan Carmack, daughter of Lee Manning, linked to Mabel Amos. The family had no knowledge of the trust or its scale. With 13,000 residents in Connecta County, the secrecy of the abuse shocked him. He recalls attending a Republican Party meeting in the Mason’s Lodge basement, where he met Dudley Godwin and Luther Upton, a Marine Corps veteran and WPGG radio host, who shared details with community leaders—yet no one acted.  

Albritton, as Executive Director of the State Ethics Commission, oversees quarterly ethics training and handles complaints, though staff review them; commissioners only review motions every two to three months. Critics question his impartiality after Cynthia Ralston’s removal and allegations of improper conduct. Three complaints were dismissed with two-sentence letters: one involving Fairhope Airport Authority board members Jack Burrell and Ray Hicks with judicial ties; another, North Baldwin utility board members Bob Wills and James Robinson, linked to off-the-books property purchases and rental to legislative delegation; a third, Fairhope City Councilman Robert Brown, who accepted an arts contract without competitive bidding.  

The Ethics Commission failed to investigate despite 140 complaints over 15 years, including one under Alabama Code §362547, which mandates investigation into personal use of office. Albritton abstained from voting on complaints involving his children’s financial dealings, including when Regions Bank received fees. Critics allege a quid pro quo: when funds were due, Albritton abstained. The complaint centers on the Mabel Amos Memorial Scholarship, where Albritton allegedly violated §494D by permitting self-dealing and a taxable expenditure under IRC §5489.  

On March 1, headlines revealed Judge Ben Bowden received $45,000 from the trust. Mike Cason reported the fallout, noting Marshall declined to comment despite filing suit. The Associated Press first reported the case in July, and the AG’s lawsuit was filed to prevent backroom settlements—potentially a strategic move ahead of Marshall’s possible gubernatorial run. The case is now in open court, with AP and USA Today, AL.com, WBRC 6 covering it.  

Despite public scrutiny, no legislators have demanded investigation of Albritton or the Regents Bank. Carol Jean Smith, a retired official known for decisive ethics warnings, contrasts sharply with the Commission’s inaction. The speaker calls the situation a “smoldering volcano” likely to erupt soon, especially as the legislative session begins. Albritton, a cousin of 2014 Senate campaign ad runner Greg Albritton, remains on the Ethics Commission despite being implicated in undisclosed dealings since 2015. His continued presence is seen as a distraction, and resignation is urged to restore integrity and focus. The host concludes with a strong call: “So say we all.”
