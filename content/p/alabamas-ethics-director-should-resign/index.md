In a filing this Tuesday, Attorney General Steve Marshall alleged in a Civil Filing that Alabama Ethics Commission Director Tom Albritton improperly benefited from a Trust where Albritton was a "Trustee", The Mabel Amos Memorial Scholarship Trust from which Albritton's children received over $100,000. Mr. Ripp made allegations including an Ethics Complaint against the Ethics Commission, a Bar Complaint against Mr. Albritton regarding the matter, a Writ of Mandamus in Circuit Court of Montgomery County to get a Judge to Order the Ethics Commission to review three of his complaints that Mr. Albritton disposed of without investigation; and the basis of his Writ was that Mr. Albritton was involved in self dealing as a Trustee of these very scholarship funds. That was in 2021. in 2022 Mr. Still ran for Attorney General of the State of Alabama (R-Baldwin) against Mr. Marshall (R-Incumbent) and made numerous stump speeches about the Ethics Commission, the Mabel Amos Trust, and Mr. Albritton's activities. So why is it that he is still the Director? That is the question we address. Tom Albritton should resign. So say we all, except for Brandon who must maintain his journalistic integrity.
