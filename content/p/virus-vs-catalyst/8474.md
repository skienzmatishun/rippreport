 "Conner [Conyers] is a banker who loans to developers".  This is not a specific allegation.  If he loans to developers, what connects any of his votes to personal gain by making loans?  Nothing.  Any loans he makes is not public and you are therefore making this allegation up, with nothing but a theory.

Dorsey is no longer in office, so the fact that you are bringing this up is nonsense.

"Haygood got elected and there is not a developer he won't say no to".   Where is the vote he made or the yes he said to a developer that he personally gained from.  It isn't there and is a made up conspiracy theory.

"Brown is a developer".  Not much to debunk here.  The question is how they use public office for private gain.  Stating what someone's occupation is does not contribute to the conversation of public servants using their office for private gain.

So, to be clear, ALL candidates who are associated with Catalyst are corrupt and breaking the law, but these are the only examples.  Great job with more gossip.   

As for general accusations, they can't be debunked because there is nothing to Fact Check.
