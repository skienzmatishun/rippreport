 Ha ha
Catalyst politicians are either realestate developers or have been bought by realestate developers.   They are the reason why sewers are overflowing and schools are crowded.   Then they want to raise our taxes instead of making themselves pay impact fees
I am looking forward to this election when the Catalysts have to answer for their doings.   Right now all they can do is scream wing nut Illuminati but that is no longer working.   Neither is phony religiousness and acting conservative
Catalysts we are going to get you out of office.   We started back in 2016 and will continue.   You will join Dorsey in your defeat
