 Dear Catalyst Fact Checker
You want examples?
Haygood got elected and there is not a developer he will say no to because he works for the developers and is one himself
Brown is a developer

Conners is a banker who loans to developers 
Dorsey is a developer
If you are a candidate and swear allegiance to the subdivision builders then Catalyst will take you as a client and get you elected 
I work in local elections and know for a fact what you refute 
I can go on and on but you as a “fact checker” know this and more
You just asked this question to try to see how much we know
Why don’t you directly refute the money Catalyst gets from the developers then funnel the money to the candidates?
We see on expenditure reports what goes on.   We also see how Catalyst candidates delayed payments until after the last election so they could hide their association with Catalyst 
We also see in uncontested races where payments were accelerated 
You delude yourself in thinking we are that naive
Catalyst must be worried because they have you trying to refute Ripp’s claims
