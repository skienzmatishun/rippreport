 You continually state that all Catalyst candidates use their office for personal gain.  Please give specifics.  You can't, so you don't.  You are the very definition of Fake News.  You spread your conspiracy theory and lies.   If there are so many Catalyst candidates and ALL are receiving personal gain, it should be easy.

The fact is they are all the ones making the hard decisions in this crisis, while you sit back and gossip on the internet.  Gossip is not informative or helpful to any cause. Gossip if for small minds, like yours.
