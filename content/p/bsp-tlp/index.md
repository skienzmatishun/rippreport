39.068,667 SARS-COV-2 cases worldwide with a total of 1,100,364 deaths. The USA has 7,997,969 cases with 217,987 deaths. Alabama tops the scales at 170,374 cases and 2,786 deaths. University of Alabama Football Coach Nick Saban and several of his staff have tested positive (Trump better hope he lives until the election).

Ronald Greeneâ€™s Family was told that he died as a result of his injuries when his car was involved in a collision as he ran from police; all evidence to the contrary (new audio leaked) indicates he was beaten to death by Louisiana State Troopers. Video not available per State Statute (that protects evidence when it is part of an investigation). Spanish Fort Mayor Mike McMillan slipped-the-noose today. He was found not guilty at a bench trial adjudicated by retired Circuit Judge James Reid. Evidence was.....E.I...E.I.......O.......The End. But we show you the video evidence anyway.

Mr. Ripp gives us the latest from the Lagniappe Newspaper and The Ripp Report. Gabe Tynes was spotted by our crew in Courtroom No 1 today so checkout Lagniappe Mobile online to get his take on the McMillan verdict and the other items we bring to your attention. Double homicide suspect Antwon Smith ws denied bond. He is accused of the murder of two Washington state men who were here working restoring the utilities after the hurricane.

Our title story: The Lincoln Project (lifelong Republicans who claim the party left them and is now a Cult of Trump). They have one goal: remove Trump, we can deal with the consequences to the party later. They have Steve Schmidt (McCain-Palin Campaign Manager) Rick Wilson (Bush Whitehouse), George Conway (yes, Kellyanne's husband) and Capt. Chesley "Sully" Sullenberger. If you have genealogy questions in Baldwin County visit the Foley Public Library. Get a sample ballot and inform yourself on the issues (consittional amendments on everything from the Taxman's Toll Road to the LandMark Districts two of them in Baldwin County) prior to heading to the polls. Check out the comment section for source materials and please wear a damn mask.
