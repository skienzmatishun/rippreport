 The fact that Baldwin County Commissioners Tucker Dorsey and DUI Chris Elliott are trying to say (flat out have lied) they have been working this New Boat Ramp project for the past 8 months is nothing short of a lie.  These two scumbags lie everyday just like we have witnessed for many years. They will tell many more lies covering their sorry asses regarding this Boat Ramp as they have started off with lies and will have to keep making new ones up to cover the first ones. These are professional deceiving thugs. Shouldn’t have to keep telling all you uneducated dumbasses that think this is not true.  If you think that the City Council or Mayor Tony Kennon of Orange Beach would not be aware of a “newly proposed” boat ramp in their own backyard, then you must be as stupid as you look. We know Tucker Dorsey and DUI Chris Elliott both are idiots. Give me a break!!!!
