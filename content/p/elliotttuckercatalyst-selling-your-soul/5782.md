 ALL of these guys need to be sent OUT of office - but the voters in Baldwin County will be too lazy to go to the polls.  When Catalyst takes over, I am leaving my four-generation home of Baldwin and going somewhere where the Catalyst Cancer has not infected.
Dear New Baldwin Residents:  May you be taxed, overgoverned, and spend the best part of your days in traffic jams.  Eventhough you live by the Bay and the Beach, you will NEVER be able to see it because you will NOT be able to afford the condos or find parking.
Besides, you will be too busy working paying for the mortgages you took on the overpriced houses that have been built in crowded "planned" neighborhoods that you are paying $1 Million dollars for a swimming pool.  You probably bought the balsawood house from DR Horton, Truland, Bellaton, and Corte.  You deserve what you get.  There is a cost to being ignorant and there are consequences to elections for which YOU did not vote.
I will sell my house to you for 1,575% of what I paid for it and go someplace else.
