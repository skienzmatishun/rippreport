By now you have seen the slick ads of Elliott and Tucker. However, when you read them you do not recognize any similarity between the written fluff and the candidates. These guys are dumping tens of thousands of dollars, donated by developers and Catalyst, to be elected at all costs. They will do anything, I repeat anything, to get elected.

The Senate seat Elliott seeks was held by Boom Boom Pittman, electing Elliott would be as bad as having Boom Boom back.

Those slick ads talk about how Elliott can bring home to Baldwin County “our fair share.” Alabama Values is another slogan they love to echo.

Some of those Alabama Values include using County Funds to promote a public relations story for their candidacy.

I hope you read the previous article and realize you are dealing with political animals, Elliott and Tucker, who want to be the Top Dogs of Baldwin County.

In Orange Beach, they bribe you with a boat ramp. In Fairhope, they deny you access to the bay. Whatever it takes. Selling their Soul is just par for the course.

A vote for Tucker Dorsey is a vote for Baldwin County Sewer and Clarence Burke. The sewer and a skunk smell the same.

One thing Elliott and Dorsey did accomplished was the mega-site, paid for on the backs of the taxpayers. A good ole boy deal that made Catalyst proud, 35 million for a cow pasture with a gate to no where. Elliott and Dorsey wanted to use BP money to repair county infrastructure because they spent the county reserves for a good ole boy deal, the Catalyst way.
