 Ah come on Ripp, these guys selling their souls is not that bad.  They may tell the people that they are men of God, but in reality they really are not.  They attend the local churches and put on a good show. For the love of money and power they have demonstrated they really don't care about values and all the stuff they claim.

Now you will see them all talk about education - they played conservative card, the religion card, now watch them play the education card.  Oh wait, they already are.
These guys are so predictable.
