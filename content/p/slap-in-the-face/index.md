Baldwin County citizens have just been slapped in the face. Want to know why Alabama is number one in corruption and the butt of jokes? It is because the judicial system stinks and people with power or money, WALK.

“Slappin Mike” McMillian the newly elected Mayor of Spanish Fort, WALKED, NOT GUILTY. Forget the video, it was a figment of our imagination. Slappin Mike joins the Sean Connery Club. The Attorneys and Judge just slapped us in the face.

What a disgrace, not one women’s club or organization says a word. Where the hell is the outrage from the men in Baldwin County. You are seeing first hand, in your face Baldwin County Justice.

{{< socialpreview url="https://web.archive.org/web/20201025133536/https://www.fox10tv.com/spanish-fort-video-posted-showing-mayor-allegedly-slapping-city-employee/video_f467d08c-2535-587a-b4d6-3366e5ab4f9c.html" >}}

Remember Sen. Tripp Pittman and the BP fraud?

How about Sen Chris Elliott and his DUI? What about the FEMA fraud in Fairhope?

Let’s not forget the elected officials in Fairhope who use their office for personal gain?

You can complain to the Alabama Judiciary, Alabama Attorney General or the Alabama Bar.

Your complaint will fall on deaf ears. That is why we are number one in corruption. The Alabama Supreme Court is just as bad.

Nothing will change, Alabama makes the Washington Swamp look like a puddle.

In Fairhope the McSherry case has been lingering for years, however the municipal attorney for Fairhope, Marcus McDowell, failed to even file charges. Another video that shows a woman, Paula DiNiardi being knocked off a bar stool.

If this was your wife how would you feel?

{{< socialpreview url="https://rippreport.com/p/women-stand-together/" >}}

This case has been in the media for almost two years.

{{< socialpreview url="https://www.lagniappemobile.com/news/fairhope-prosecutor-claims-assault-charge-against-mcsharry-will-be-refiled/article_891e7d7d-a635-5a45-b715-38b5e01d1bf5.html" >}}

McDowell insisted he would file charges and then did nothing.

He cares less that he is on the record. In Baldwin County the two best places to assault a women are in Fairhope and Spanish Fort.

Gabriel Tynes of Lagniappe spent the day in court, here is his report.

If I ever needed any support in my claim about Alabama corruption, then Mr Gallion has delivered.

His book will open your eyes. What will it take for Alabama citizens to break the cabal of political criminals?

{{< socialpreview url="https://www.amazon.com/Shadow-Government-Southern-Style-Second-ebook/dp/B088ZTDQPW" >}}

Told in the distinctive voice of a seasoned Alabama attorney, this book weaves many a sordid tale of politics and political figures--local, state, and federal--gone awry, beginning with the murder of Alabama's newly elected Attorney General in the 1950s and stretching into the shady shenanigans of recent times.

The author includes many personal stories of his most interesting and challenging clients. This is a must-read for anyone interested in what goes on behind the curtain.

The author, Thomas Gallion III, will be at Page and Palette Bookstore in Fairhope, tomorrow at 3:00 pm.

If you can not attend tomorrow, please get the book, Shadow Government Southern Style.

## IT IS ANOTHER SLAP IN THE FACE OF ALABAMA.
