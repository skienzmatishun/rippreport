 Judge Reid "“So what does the court do? You have to fall back on law,” he said. “The state is not required to convince guilt beyond all doubt, but beyond all reasonable doubt. I have to say in this case, because of the contradictory nature of evidence, my mind is left in the condition where I cannot say the defendant is guilty beyond all reasonable doubt, so I find the defendant not guilty.”
