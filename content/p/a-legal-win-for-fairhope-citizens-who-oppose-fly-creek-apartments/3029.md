 "Twisted" about describes it.  You mention the health insurance for employees (and families, all of which has been covered by the City before - seriously?  I've never heard of another company doing that...these city employees are so freaking spoiled).  A very nice plan was presented at one of the recent council meetings.  What do you want to bet that Burrell will insist the city stay with the current insurer, regardless of whether or not the plan that was described is comparable (or better) in price and coverage.  My guess is that Burrell will NOT accept the plan change for no reason other than HE CAN...and every single thing with that man is a power play.
