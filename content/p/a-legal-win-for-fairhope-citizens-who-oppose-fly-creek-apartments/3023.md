 Georgia, why in the world do you think that SherryLea should resign?  I am literally mystified by this.  She is working incredibly hard for our city, securing grants, opening up resident participation comments about responsible growth, etc.  In addition to her skillset, I like that she is calm, articulate and professional.  What exactly has SherryLea done that you don't agree with?
