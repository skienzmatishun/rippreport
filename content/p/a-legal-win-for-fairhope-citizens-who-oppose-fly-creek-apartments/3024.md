 Well, to be fair, three of the council members did beat out incumbents, along with the Mayor...so maybe not including the majority in "y'all" and "wake up people" would be more accurate.  Just because there are still loudmouths in Fairhope who complain and criticize and act like we're all going to hell in a handbasket doesn't mean that most of us feel that way.  Yes, we're facing some serious problems here, most notably with infrastructure.  (And anyone who doesn't put the blame for this exactly on the shoulders of this administration's predecessors is a moron.)  But all forward progress starts with new voices and new direction, and that's where we're headed...regardless of how Burrell and Boone want to pretend like they're still in charge.
