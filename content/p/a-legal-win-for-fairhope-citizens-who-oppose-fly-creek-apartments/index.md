In June of this year, the Planning and Zoning Board expressed their frustration with citizens of Fairhope who defend themselves by legal means. Friends of Fly Creek, Plaintiffs — and certainly friends of the public, brought a lawsuit against the City of Fairhope, Fairhope Planning and Zoning, Fairhope City Council, and Leaf River group LLC, Defendants. The Defendants in turn moved to dismiss the lawsuit all together. Planning and Zoning doubled down on their decision, calling the lawsuit "frivolous."

{{< socialpreview url="https://thefairhopetimes.blogspot.com/2016/06/controversial-fairhope-apartment.html" >}}

Mr. George Robards, a contributor of the Mayor and members of the Planning and Zoning, who also enjoys municipal contracts and contracts through Single Tax, was the loudest voice screaming, "frivolous lawsuit!"

Well, Mr Robards, Mayor, Planning and Zoning, Fairhope City Council and Leaf River Group — you were wrong and that is the opinion of the **COURT**. Your motion to dismiss was **DENIED**.

**PLEASE PAY ATTENTION**: What this means is the lawsuit can move forward into a discovery phase.

_Who said what?_

_Let us see your e-mails._

They will have to produce all documents, phone calls, donations and much more. What could follow if it goes to court — and I doubt that, is testimony by the planning department explaining the intimidation the Mayor used against city employees, (which he damn well did).

This all may be a moot issue if we elect a new Mayor for Fairhope. A new Mayor will appoint a new Planning and Zoning Board and the old and worthless board can go fishing with Citizen Kant.

The failed Planning and Zoning Board has cost us millions in lawsuits. This is just one more lawsuit that they will not win, to add to their legacy, thanks George and Planning and Zoning.

Please remember the developer Leaf River Group has one year to be under construction or the zoning is reversed to the original zoning, **NO APARTMENTS**. They have 10 months to prepare for trial and Kant must win re-election.

**ELECT A NEW MAYOR < APPOINT A NEW PLANNING AND ZONING BOARD < PROBLEM SOLVED, NO APARTMENTS. REMEMBER FLY CREEK.**

**WE WISH THE DEFENDANTS AND ESPECIALLY THE MAYOR AND BOSOM BUDDY ARTHUR CORTE A WONDERFUL WEDNESDAY**
