 Mr. Ripp, I have a question about this comment regarding Fidler, Sullivan and Heathcoe.

"They were promised that the council would settle the lawsuits"

How does this work exactly?  I think I am correct in saying that the payment of lawsuits such as these will be determined by the City's insurance carrier.  Is this right?  If I am right, how will the Council be involved - other than of course trying to talk the insurance company into doing what they want, which I obviously believe they are not above.  

Although I don't think for a moment that this is a possibility (I'm actually just asking from a legal standpoint), what if one of the claims against the City turned into a lawsuit but the insurance company refused to pay for it?  If there was not legitimate cause for the suit, the insurance company WOULD refuse to pay it, correct?  Surely they won't pay any damned thing that's asked for regardless of merit.  But, in that case, would it then mean that the claimant would not receive any money, or that the City would be responsible for paying the award?

Thanks.
