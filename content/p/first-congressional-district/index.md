This is a very important election and the sparks are flying but when the dust settles it is clear that one major distinction stands out in the race CATALYST.

CARL IS NOT CATALYST, HIS OPPONENT, “Lowtower” IS CATALYST, “The status quo, good ole boys that use politics for personal gain. Baldwin County needs to rid itself of CATALYST, not send it to Washington.

“The AL-1 race has evolved into a battle between the activist and business wings of the Republican Party. The Business Council of Alabama, Alabama Farmers Federation and Byrne himself are backing Carl, while the conservative flame Club for Growth is backing Hightower. The Washington-based Club is expected to spend more than $1 million on the race for ads supporting Hightower and attacking Carl.”
