 Hey you win some and you lose some - but Ripp ain't going anywhere soon.  We are in this for the LONG haul.   
Ripp, you have exposed Catalyst and the Good Ole Boys.  More and more people in Baldwin County are beginning to find out the dirty dealings outside developers are doing in buying and paying for politicians who sell themselves as Conservative Christians.  
Because of this, you have toppled some BIG DOGS and exposed the rest.
The mere fact that a change of government made it on the ballot and got the Catalysts scared was enough this time around.
People are onto the outside developers.  Even Tucker Dorsey tried to tell people he wasn't a developer before he LOST.  Now Brown is trying to tell people he isn't a developer.
Hey Catalyst: we are STILL coming for you.  We will run you and your pump grinders, your cheaply built cookie-cutter subdivisions, and your hypocritical ways out of Baldwin County.

Bahahahahaha back at you.
