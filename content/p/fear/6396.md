 Well if Tim Kant is going to run for Mayor I hope the rest of his corruption comes out before. Not all of his corruption has been brought out but soon will.  It is funny what he thought he could get by with &amp; thought no one could find out but he had others involved also not only in Fairhope but some of the CORRUPT Attorneys in Fairhope &amp; Baldwin County as well.  It is MORE than an Ethics Violation.  And yes he has even been PAID by some in Baldwin County for MANY favors!!!   Been paid by landowners etc to get what they want - he should have been locked up years ago.  People that do not want to believe all this just wait!!!
