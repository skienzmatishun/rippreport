## FAIRHOPE

**FEAR OF CHANGE**, that is what is driving the NO vote in Fairhope. Special interest, Catalyst and the Catalyst “At Large” Council, are relying on a couple of the oldest political tools in the campaign war chest, fear and ignorance. The NO votes efforts are supported by special interests, NOT the citizen’s interest.

FAIRHOPE For 12 years The Ripp Report has been reporting on issues related to Fairhope. One thing that is perfectly obvious is that the way Fairhope has been governed, has not worked.

Alabama is the most corrupt State in the United States and Baldwin County is in competition with Jefferson County as the most corrupt county in Alabama. THAT IS A FACT

Let that soak in!

The CATALYST NO vote motto says it all:

## “IF YOU DON’T KNOW VOTE NO”

How about if you don’t know, find out, investigate, educate yourself. Just saying NO is like straight ticket voting. It requires NO thought process.

This slogan questions your intelligence and asks you to remain ignorant.

VOTING YES moves Fairhope forward, not backwards. VOTING YES means that Fairhope is going to have the most common form of Government. VOTING YES gives everyone representation and helps to prevent corruption by SPECIAL INTERESTS.
