 Georgia,  I am old and yes I was in that line. I did not vote the way you insinuated old people vote and the CHURCH has never determined how I vote!  I consider your comments right up there with racist remarks!!  Some people just cannot take it when things donâ€™t go THEIR WAY!!  You might as well be on the playground at middle school. Grow Up!!!!!!!!
