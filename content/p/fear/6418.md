 Burrell got more votes because he ran against a young woman who was not only new to Fairhope but who also had no relevant experience.  No one knew who she was; there were rumors that Kant had recruited her to run so that Burrell would be sure to win, but I don't know if that is true.  Karin Wilson ran against then Mayor Kant and received more votes than he did.  You are comparing oranges and pineapples when you compare Burrell's share of the vote against a virtual stranger.  Also, Burrell and Brown both ran on their opposition to the apartments at Fly Creek; then after winning, they both supported the apartments.......I don't trust either of them to honor their promises again and neither should anyone else.
