 The current form of City Government has shown to be infighting and adults who can not be civil and respectful of oppposing ideas. 
If you vote NO , things will remain the same.
If we change and take the power from the Council, and a professional administrator is in charge this will change the way we handle and solve the Cityâ€™s day to day business. We might actually get some positives accomplished. The majority DID vote for CHANGE. So it can not hurt to VOTE YES.
When you vote Tim back in, you will still be in charge.
