 Our coffee club talked about the new governmeent and who will run for what when it passes. Somebody at Julwins mentioned that Kant "may be in trouble we will see..."
What that means I don't know but I seriously doubt he runs again. He has
gained weight and looks like he would be a no at this point based on 
what I am hearing. I do hear that Burrell and Brown would likely be in the same district and that Boone and Robinson and the banker aren't running. Looks like Burrell or Brown or Colby Cooper for mayor.  That's the word on the street. fyi.
