 I would NOT vote No in the Fairhope election even if Burrell, Boone &amp; Brown paid me. I will definitely vote YES!!!!!   And of course one of the landowners was Bobby Faust that paid Tim Kant a HUGE amount of money to get what he wanted &amp; still plays the same games for the Faust family.  Voters please beware to what had been going on &amp; do not be fooled as people have been in the past.   Yes court records were sealed to not get their mess revealed &amp; out in the public eye.  What does that tell you??  They are corrupt &amp; they know it!!!
