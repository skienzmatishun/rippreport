 So sad you believe everything you read in a biased newspaper or a bad blog or a political flyer. Corrections were made but no one saw that. Court records were sealed but at the request of another party because they didn't want their personal information revealed publicly.  Lies just keep being repeated. Go to the court records and look at facts. I dare you.
