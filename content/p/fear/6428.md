 I was one of the ones that voted for Burrell in last election - whole family did.  Well what he promised he did not do - we will not be fooled again. - also after watching his arrogant behavior which he tries to be very controlling at the council meetings - he is more than a turnoff.  Wish to goodness he woukd go back to where he came from - Mississippi!!  He is not wanted in Fairhope!!
