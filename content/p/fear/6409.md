 Seriously, who are you? If you know so much for a fact. Use your name. Stop perpetuating rumors and share some facts 
Bobby Faust is a Fairhope property owner where his family has lived for 75  years. Other than that he sold his Fairhope Nut Processing plant to the City of Fairhope. Tell me about any other "projects" he has where he needs to be concerned about who is mayor? He has fought against a development using our family's drive way as an entrance.  I personally have never heard him complain about Fairhope's current mayor beyond the false information she allowed someone to send out in a mailer. If you think my 84 year old father is some sort of "force to be reckoned with" you are sadly mistaken. He is just a nice man.
