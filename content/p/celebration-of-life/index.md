A Celebration of life for Carolyn Amick will be held Oct. 1 2022 between 2 and 4 PM Family and Friends are invited. The address is 22985 Highridge Road, Fairhope Alabama. A second Celebration of Life will be held in Birmingham in early October. The exact date has yet to be determined.

Carolynâ€™s family greatly appreciates the kind comments and love we have received since Carolyn has left us. Carolyn would be overwhelmed at the response from hundreds of friends and relatives from around the world. We look forward to seeing some of you in Fairhope and Birmingham
