 I hope you are right.  However, I fear you are wrong.  History has shown us that when people don't fully understand anything new, they either don't vote at all or vote against it.  Unfortunately, Fresh Start Fairhope muddied the waters from the get-go, confusing everyone about the district issue. As a result, people don't trust the entire process.  It really is a shame as the benefits are many and the drawbacks are few (unless you're a Council member, and then of course you don't want districts).  I would be very surprised if this vote passes.
