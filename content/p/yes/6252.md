 I have been involved with Fresh Start Fairhope and most of these people are from Fairhope and trying to stop people like Jack Burrell from destroying the City.  Robert Brown is supposed to be from Fairhope but he appears concerned only with retaining his own power, which is natural.  What is NOT natural is throwing the entire city's taxpayers under the bus by lying about what a City Manager could do to save our City.
