 I don't have to worry about using the new bridge in my lifetime. It takes 4 years to widen S.R. 181 and it's still not done so I'll never see the bridge completed, but the fake news media is trying to tell its viewers that 181 is 60% done. LOL! I know it's very hard to work on 181 in the winter with all the snow &amp; cold.
