 The “Ethics” Committee is a joke in this state.  I have worked for the state here in Montgomery for 26 years.   Most of what this Committee does is gather annual reports from state employees and check off boxes.   They are so busy trying to catch little dogs that the big dogs get away 
As someone once said, the “Ethics” Committee is las effective as a pimp watching over his hooker’s virginity.
