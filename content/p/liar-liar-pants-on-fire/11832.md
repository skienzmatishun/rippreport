 You have a good point. The media, government, and US pharmaceutical industry have given us no reason to trust them.  We needed to pull in one direction but it's impossible if no one trusts the ones in charge.

I've said before that places like Denmark and New Zealand have been able to open back up completely.  It's no coincidence those countries are ranked at the top for lack of government corruption.

It worked for them, so I believe it would work for us. Pfizer is not the only vaccine out there. They should not be able to profit off of this.  But what do you do, commie?

Don't forget Afghaniscam.
