 Who on the council is the most crooked? I vote Jack with Jay right behind him. Jay carries Jack's water. Washes his car. Watches his dog. Jay is a sad little man. Sold his soul to the machine and the city lost. If he was a decemt3 attorney he would have not had to go back but he is clueless when it comes to lawyering. The city loses of course. Jay is just a yes man. Plain to see. I wonder if he and Robert Brown still talk. They are rumored to be in cahoots with different business ventures. These guys are shady. Beware of their moves
