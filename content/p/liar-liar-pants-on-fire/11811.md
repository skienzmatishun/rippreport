 I feel sorry for the good, fair, gullable people of Fairhope. They have been a honey hole for predatory developers for some time now and the building is going crazy on the outskirt of town and I am afraid its curtains for the rest of us. They have allowed way too many people with not enough new roads built. Any body can plainly see there is no end to the madness.
