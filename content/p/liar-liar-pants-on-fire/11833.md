 See my other comment with the link to twitter. A ton of data got hacked from a web host. There's a lot to go through but there's already evidence that all these right-wing websites, including infowars, had their personal information being forwarded to an account in Russia including security questions.  I can't tell you what to believe but I don't think you will find truth in Russian propaganda either.
