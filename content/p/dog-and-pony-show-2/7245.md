 No. They are not. Alabama is not a country. If it were, judging by the stats, you'd be in a third world impoverished country.  American citizens are free to move about their country.  Growth is not the problem. That's inevitable. That's America. The problem is the lack of any long term, or even short term vision for planning. It's like blaming the Mexicans for coming for jobs while ignoring the white people who employ them. So the problem continues. Building a wall won't change that. Put your glasses on, maybe you'll see what's 5 feet in front of you and learn something.  Maybe then you would see it's the elected officials who are in the best position to solve these problems. And their current solution is short term monetary gain for a few of their friends.  That's the problem.
