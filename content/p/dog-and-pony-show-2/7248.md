 I said Alabama would be a third world country. But it's not a third world thanks to the support and trade of other regions of the country.  I'm just going off the stats. I have no problem living here. Despite what you think, all residents here have the right to be concerned and push for change.  I'm not just talking about the north. I'm talking about the 48 states that rank higher than Alabama in high school rankings.
