 I would bake for days on end if the end result would be selling the coin-operated council along with the cookies!  Count me in.  I think that we can draw a straight line from Jack Burrell to the disaster that Fairhope is rapidly becoming; if he cared at all about the City of Fairhope (and had nothing to hide), he would have stepped aside as Council President long ago.  It is more than clear that those of us who pay attention are sick to death of him, but the rest of the Council are either terrified of him or of what he may 'have on them'.  These meetings are an embarrassment to democracy. .. little wonder that there are metal detectors sometimes now.   Jack needs to go (even if we have to pay to put him on another planet, it would be well worth it.). There are deceitful and felonious politicians everywhere, but I have never encountered one that is such a smarmy evil lizard.  I know that this sounds hateful, but remember that Burrell was the one that 'fought against the Fly Creek Apartments' until he was re-elected last time and then he became Corte's biggest supporter. He just counts on Fairhope voters to be so stupid and old and they don't know what's happening to them!  His dis-respect to the Mayor is appalling and makes Fairhope a very undesirable place to visit, live or conduct business.  I hope that all of the new young people moving in will send him packing.
