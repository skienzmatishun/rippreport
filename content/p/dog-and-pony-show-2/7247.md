 So if you are saying that Alabama is a third world country, then why did you move here to the "third world?"  I know why.  It is because the place that you came from was not as great as you would like us to think.  Places up north and on the west coast are dumps today with their high taxes, crime, and crowded places.  Now you want to come here and turn us into the places from which you fled.
No thanks, I will keep living in my "third world" and maybe we can get the "Enlightened People" from up north to return and perhaps fix the mess they caused.
