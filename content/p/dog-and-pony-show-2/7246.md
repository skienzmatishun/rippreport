 I predict you'll keep those glasses off. You'll keep complaining that it's the new residents that are the cause. You'll believe anything that your buddies in the council preach.  Maybe your income is dependent on the construction? That attitude of long-time locals first allows them to favor old time friends with established businesses and council ties regardless of the damage you cause.  Judging by the local school rankings, maybe it's the lack of a decent education of the long time locals that causes this situation. Chances are, according to the stats, those moving here come from better schools than Fairhope Trailer Highschool in Fairhope and perhaps that's why they understand the truth of the situation. Maybe, just maybe, the long time locals are the problem?? Living where you grew up with, keeping your close-minded xenophobic views is not something to celebrate. It's the thing that happens by default. What boring people do.  Fairhope is growing because of good jobs in Mobile. They aren't giving those jobs away to people without a decent education. Chances are, they understand this better than you.
