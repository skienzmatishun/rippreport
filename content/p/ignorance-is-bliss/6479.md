 From Lagniappe article:  "City Clerk Lisa Hanks said... the Probate Court could only provide one voting machine for each of seven polling places. Hanks said the referendum left only four spare voting machines available countywide.  “Lines were a little longer due to that … we didn’t have a big issue until probably 3 or 4 [p.m.] and it stayed that way until 7,” she said."

Was she drunk that day or what?  To say lines were a "little longer" is ludicrous.  Ask anyone who stood in the referendum line at any time of the day.  It was ridiculous and caused MANY folks to not vote at all.  Worst coordination I've ever seen in all my years of voting.
