 Several people who have fed her and tried to help her have given media interviews stating that 'Missy is not harmless' and that they made a big mistake when then began feeing her.  She is clearly not very nice because she monopolizes the kids' park.  Even if you think that she is harmless, she is stealing city resources and frightening taxpayers.  She was such an embarrassment at the Fairhope Film Festival.  The police department should obey Alabama laws. If the City Council wants to keep her, they need to take her home or else indemnify the City against lawsuits that will definitely be filed if they don't get her booted from public areas.  Again, they are so welcome to take her to their own homes within the city.  Additionally, are you aware of the $100 Million dollar lawsuit 'Missy' filed when she was living in her DIP storage unit?  This woman is a legal liability in too many ways to count.  Jack can take her home if he wants her.
