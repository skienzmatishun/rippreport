 I too read where the two Catalyst flunkies haven't been in town for more than seven years. I myself am fifth generation Baldwin County. You see, Catalyst is IMPORTING these flunkies.  They are new to the area.  I wish they would go back and finish messing up the place from which they came. 

Oh wait!  They HAVE messed up their area which is why they are coming here to trash this area, make a few bucks, and move on.  I wish somehow we could stop this cancer with Catalyst.
