I knew I could count on the Lagniappe to produce a comprehensive article about the recent referendum election in Fairhope. Well done.

### Fairhope voters reject council-manager form of government - Lagniappe Mobile

![](https://lagniappemobile.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/COVERP3.jpg)

You can’t say it wasn’t a valiant effort. After more than 800 people signed a petition in less than two weeks — at least 779 signatures were certified — a special-interest group in Fairhope forced an election for a new form of government, but it was ultimately defeated Nov. 6. The group, Fresh Start Fairhope, …

Please Read: [lagniappemobile.com/fairhope-voters-reject-council-manager-form-of-government/](https://lagniappemobile.com/fairhope-voters-reject-council-manager-form-of-government/)

I read the article while I was in Puerto Rico and wondered how many people in Fairhope actually have any understanding of what motivated the no vote. The Ripp Report posted it’s thoughts after the election:

{{< socialpreview url="https://rippreport.com/p/you-win-some-you-lose-some/" >}}

The Lagniappe article sure clears up some of the suspected backroom motives of some. First off Forever Fairhope was backed by Can’t loyalist who invested in a political PAC. These are some of the same individuals who support Catalyst.

It also appears, true to Catalyst form, that they recruited two men to be their front men to carry their banner. Forever Fairhope banner carriers were Mr .Gary Thorson and Bill Pennington. They have only been residents of Fairhope for five years and seven years. Thorson stated “ Both admitted prior to the referendum they haven’t been very involved in Fairhope politics.” Pennington went even further in admitting “ that before the petition was circulated”, he “had no idea there were problems in the city government.”

So these two men hook up with Can’t and Catalyst backers to become involved in something that they knew little about! The fact that they say that they had no knowledge of problems within the Fairhope Catalyst City Council, speaks volumes. How in the hell could you have lived in Fairhope for the last 5 to 7 years and not know of any problems with the city government? Better yet how could you become involved supporting a particular view and be so ignorant of your local government?

I suspect you were recruited to cover for the good ole boys and Catalyst, who like to stay in the shadows. Now I could be entirely wrong, but I don’t think so. To be fair both gentleman may have just woke up one morning and became civic minded and decide to do this on their own. But one must ask themselves how did they become involved with Catalyst backers?

Both men admit their ignorance of Fairhope City Government so let’s give them the benefit of the doubt and see what their next venture is. Will it be running for city council in 2020, backed by the same PAC and Catalyst? Or will they spend a little time to research just how corrupt Fairhope has been and lift that banner again, against corruption.

May I suggest Mr Thorson and Mr Pennington read the back issues of The Ripp Report. They can even contact me and I would be happy to meet with them to give them details of the corruption that has been happening for the last 15 years in Fairhope. They will need to bring several legal pads.

Knowing or unwittingly your efforts succeeded in holding Fairhope in the grasp of Catalyst.

If you were duped then you will be active in combating corruption, if you were willing partners of Catalyst then you will remain silent. Time will tell and we will be paying attention so I leave you with a little nugget of corruption, that I am sure you had no idea about.
