 Which ones of the Catalyst Council members have made the decision to allow Ms. Hudson, the scary fingernail woman, to live at the Pavilion at the Fairhoper's  Park?  I understand that numerous complaints have been lodged but that the police department has been told to 'leave her alone' because several of the council members neither live near there or have children who might be frightened by her.  My guess would be that Robinson and Conyers would want to protect the city from lawsuits and that the bumble bees would let her stay so that they could feel self-important.  I know that Chief Petties was not big on state laws that funnel down, but we have a more progressive Chief now so I hope that she will do the right thing for the City and not just blindly do what random Council members demand.  This is not a good situation with that crazy woman living on the pavilion, cooking and watching television (does she have an account with the utility corp or has Burrell granted her a generator from the City?)
