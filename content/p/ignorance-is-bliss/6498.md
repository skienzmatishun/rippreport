 I respect your opinion however the present form of government does NOT fit your outline, that is the problem. Fairhope is not a sleepy village on the bay with a population of 5000. Currently the city has a population of 18,000 and another 18,000 living in Fairhope outside city limits.Please remember the apartments, the council went AGAINST the majority.
