I saw where Thompson Engineer's owner was pushing for more soccer field spending on facebook. Sure spend more money on a lopsided soccer field.

remember y'all it was pushed as something to compete with foley.

right.

like the dyas triangle "park."

like the sewer upgrade "still pumping human shit into the bay."

like the uneven soccer fields that will NEVER host a single team.

don't you understand that these "deals" are not for the people.

They are for the bastards on the sh(tty council and their sick thieving
friends like tucker dorsey and trip pittman.

Fairhope is an embarrassment. Fake people. Fake town. Fake government. Read the Bible and act on it hypocrites! Oh and go ahead and vote for Roy Moore. Jesus help us in Alabama.
