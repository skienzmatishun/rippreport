 FYI it is Columbia, Alabama, not Columbiana. With that said, "The Ripp Report" covers corruption in all of Alabama. The investigating and reporting of our corruption is a breath of fresh air to our citizens who have endured corruption from the last two mayors. Yes, we are a small town, but we too suffer from political corruption. Thanks Paul Ripp.
