 This same stuff was on Reddit and was taken down for being false news. The ones who are making all the false accusations on the mayor and police chief of Columbia Al were on Reddit creating fake accounts posing to be citizens of Columbia and commenting to try and make like people agree. An actual citizen apparently got word and called them out for posing as him. I also see they are pulling the same stunt on this news article. As one of the comments shows it’s from the concerned citizen which is the one who has wrote the stuff in the article but on their comment at the bottom put thanks Paul Ripp. So now your posing as the man over this news platform. It’s clear that the one commenting was speaking as being a citizen of Columbia and Mr. Ripp isn’t. It’s a shame he already posted your false news article for you to turn around and pose as him. It’s more than obvious this “concerned citizen” as they call themselves will make up any lie they can and pose as whoever they can just to try and get their way.
