If you watched this legislative session unfold in Alabama you have to be asking yourself: "What are our priorities?" And at the local level in Baldwin County: A new County Jail (damn near 1,000 beds) with a hiring plan that none of us have ever seen to include the hiring of 6 new Deputy Sheriffs and 6 new Correction Officers per year for 5 years. With County Commission support of all these new hires and facilities it is only logical that Baldwin Court Services will have increased volume and need to hire more people too (no conflicts of interest there, move along...).

Baldwin County Sewer Service (unregulated by the Alabama Public Service Commission by a Constitutional Amendment) is being required by ADEM to hold a public hearing on the expansion of their treatment plant on Fort Morgan Road. We hope that you will take time to attend and educate yourself regarding this project and the inability of the County Commission or Local Legislative Delegation to impose any regulation on this private utility, whatsoever. The War for Ukraine continues to rage and we give you Raines two cents on what to expect next and how they really sank the Moskva.

The Brooks, Britt, Durant race is as farcical as it is destructive to the Alabama Republican Party. And thanks to the "Citizen's United" SCOTUS decision some years ago, a product of the Military Industrial Complex can buy a Senate Seat in Alabama. Donkey murder, Tesla Twitter, no Siegleman's at Alabama Law Day, and SHOCKER: Examiners Of Public Accounts investigation into the Brookside Alabama Police Department shows multiple irregularities. And on the bright side, it is Easter, Passover and Ramadan so please exercise your religion as you please tomorrow. The weather has turned (88 degrees today)and the State of Alabama is going to allow us to begin harvesting the Red Snapper on May 27th. And a good read well worth your time appeared this week in [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/05/social-media-democracy-trust-babel/629369/) happy reading and Happy Easter.
