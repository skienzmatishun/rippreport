The Ripp Report has written about CATALYST for years. We have filed numerous complaints with the Attorney General involving political corruption and have received no reply. It seems that political corruption is not as important as the sewer violations.

It is also interesting that all the complaints about Fly Creek and Publix were ignored by ADEM, Alabama Department of Environmental Management, aka Alabama Department of Environmental Maniacs, years ago.

*This article has a paywall, however is free at most news stands.*

The irony of the lawsuit is that Fairhope has done more than any municipality in Baldwin County or the Eastern Shore, to correct sewer deficiencies. The timeline for sewer infrastructure repairs since 2016 was publicly published by the Mayor.

{{< socialpreview url="https://web.archive.org/web/20201021131024/www.mayorkarinwilson.com/timeline-for-sewer-system-upgrades-water-quality-initiatives/" >}}

Mayor Wilson pledged, on her campaign platform, that the sewer infrastructure would be a priority of her administration.

She has keep her word but the CATALYST City Council refused for two years to fund the sewer rehabilitation plan.

The CATALYST Council still refuses to hire engineers and professional personnel dedicated to sewer improvements.

In Lagniappe the Mayor stated

> We’ve been trying to get an engineering and technical department funded but the council has absolutely refused.--They are totally adamant against hiring-- but if we hire engineers now, that will totally help our case. I don’t know that we would have this lawsuit if those positions were funded when I asked for them. But it’s one of the things where we could be up Shit’s Creek, no pun intended, if we weren't already doing what we have been doing.

This is the same CATALYST Council that now wants to drag up all the habits and bad characters of the past, who are the very ones responsible for the decay of Fairhope’s sewer infrastructure.

This is the same CATALYST Council that has it’s own justice system. The same CATALYST Council that disparages and bullies women, while at the same time supports it’s CATALYST friends who are accused of domestic abuse, assault and liquor violations.

Fairhope and Baldwin County need to flush CATALYST down the toilet, or we will all be up the CATALYST Shit Creek.
