 My experience with BCEDA and other “Economic” or “Advisory” councils is that they are a bunch of retired guys who couldn’t give up control when they retired and they didn’t take up golf or get a hobby.   Their wives kicked them out of the house to make them get a life.
Then some politician “appoints” them to some bullshit council and these retired guys now feel important again.
Then these guys either hold meetings with chambers of commerce, bug the school board for attention, or serve as a useful idiot of some politician that appointed them.   If a major outfit farts on camera and the news media is there, you will see one of these retired guys run after a TV camera like a dog after a meat wagon.
I just wish they would have taken up golf when they retired or at least discover their grandkids
