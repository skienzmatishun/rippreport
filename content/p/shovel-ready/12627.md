 I get so sick of you hypocrites calling your stooges "Christian."  They are NOT Christian.  They are hypocrites posing as Christians to get the vote.  If they had any shame that a true Christian would have, they would not be wearing the "Christian" badge like an advertisement.  The people are catching onto these hypocrites.  
They say they love Jesus, but they really love money and power while they would sell their own mother for the next buck.
BOOM!
