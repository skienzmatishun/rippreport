 We actually can hold more than sixty or seventy thousand based on professional estimates. All this to do about growth is silly. Everyone is moving here because it is wonderful. Close to beaches. Great schools. Great people (few minorities). Great roads (no crumbling like in MS and LA). Great outdoors. Great location.  You can't beat Fairhope. Ripp you have to give credit where it is due. Fairhope isn't number one place to live in AL because of the ripp report. Don't kid yourself. Email me when we are no longer number one and I'll listen. Until then you need to find another hobby.
