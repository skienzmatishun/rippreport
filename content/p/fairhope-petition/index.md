If you live in Fairhope this petition is of great importance to you and your family. All the petition is asking of the City Council is not to dispose of any city property until the scheduled land use plan and comprehensive plan is completed. The second thing the citizens ask is to be a part of the decision. The Council and Weeks Bay have attempted to go around public participation. That is not the way a democracy works.

New details about this politically motivated effort by the CATALYST Council will be forthcoming.

The below articles will inform you how the City Council and Weeks Bay planned, behind closed doors,

to transfer control and management of city property, 106 acres, valued at 20 million, without public input.

The Council almost succeeded in the transfer had it not been for several citizens and a couple of lawyers paying attention. This council is the worst Fairhope has seen in 25 years. It is no coincidence that they all have CATALYST and Canâ€™t connections.

The Council is using the narrative that the land was purchased for a park. This is categorically untrue, it was part of a legal settlement where the city LOST and had to buy the property.

The Council and Weeks Bay are now trying to claim that the best use of this city land is to insure that the city has little or no control over it for ETERNITY. Stand up Fairhope you are being robbed without a gun.

The petition had 325 names at the last council meeting it is at 527 now, HELP us convenience the City Council and Weeks Bay that the citizens of the community want city property managed by the City of Fairhope.

How can al.com write an article about the Conservation Easement and not include the citizens petition?
