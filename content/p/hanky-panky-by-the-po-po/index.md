It seems the Baldwin County Sheriff's Department has internal hanky panky problems. One of the top officers in the Sheriff's Department has been having a little extra curricular activity with a subordinate female employee, who is married to a fellow officer.  No official action by the sheriff has been taken, in fact, looks like it's covered up from the public.  Why should we care?  Because the Sheriff's Department is well known for cover ups.  The problem is that fellow officers are now wondering how this situation is not public and severe action has not been taken against the senior officer.  The Ripp Report has had 3 different people call us giving us dates, names and ranks of the individuals involved.  Let's see how Sheriff Hoss Mack is going to spin this sordid story. 

This is just another chapter of a Sheriff's Department that has been run by one person with no supervision, no transparency and no accountability.  Another chapter is the wrongful conviction case of Murray Lawrence Jr., Hoss Mack was the lead investigator, that produced zero evidence against Mr. Lawrence.  Robert Wilters, our DA, was the presiding judge over the kangaroo court.  You can find out much more about this case through the <a href="https://rippreport.com">Ripp Report</a>.  This case strongly resembles the Netflix documentary "Just Mercy".  Mr. Lawrences case is currently being followed for a future documentary similar to "Just Mercy".
