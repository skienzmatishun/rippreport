 I can remember when Baldwin County belonged to the residents.  Then outside developers came in and told the voters they were Christians 
The politicians formed a group and named it Elliot, Haygood, and Stacy.  Elliott and Haygood got in office and turned the kabal over to Boone and renamed the group Catalyst.  Catalyst would connect political candidates with developers and the money needed to fund campaigns
This group got so strong that it could actually pick and choose itâ€™s clients and choose political candidates
Today we have a County with elected officials posing as religious people when in fact they either are developers or work for developers 
The voters in Baldwin County have only themselves to blame.   The voters did not deserve this area and because of it, they will lose it either by over development or being gentrified out of the area because it will too expensive to live here due to prices and taxes
Look at Orange Beach and Gulf Shores.  There are two classes of people that live there. The wealthy people who have moved in and the locals who work in the tourist industry and have to commute from Foley and places north or live in trailer parks.   The locals have became an underclass in their own hometown 
Once again, Baldwin voters need only blame themselves
