 Yes, Chris Warner, we know.   We have read this before.  Catalyst is responsible for ruining Baldwin County.   We know.  
You had us at hello
The people of Baldwin must rise up and get the Catalysts out of office.  They serve themselves
Heck, Baldwin County residents cannot go to the beach anymore   
You can blame the Fairhope judge and the developers for this
Haygood, Cox, Corte, and the rest of the Catalysts have stolen our birthright.  They MUST be held accountable for their crimes
