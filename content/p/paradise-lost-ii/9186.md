 Alabama, last place or close to it in almost every important metric. 2nd most reliant on federal funding. The federal government loses $2 for every $1 received in fed taxes. Subsidized by mostly blue states most of which have large urban centers which drives our economy and the producers of skilled workers.  But they fail to deliver services?  Easy to say for a state that provides no services and relies on the feds.  Maybe then we could afford better city planning?  Maybe the boomers are getting a return on their investment, bailing out Alabama throughout the years? Maybe they are the only ones who can afford to move for retirement?
