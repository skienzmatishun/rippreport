 What these immature hateful people don't understand that we will lose our piece of paradise if we let the old regime continue their evil ways. 

No one can see the forest through the trees with this council. No plan, no vision, just obstruction.  

Only 2 are from Fairhope and they've already been cashing in. Kevin and Robert. The rest have no clue what our history is and no desire to protect our quality of life.
