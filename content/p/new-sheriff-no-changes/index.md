 It is no surprise that Governor Kay Ivey believed all the BS Hoss Mack told her. Someone woke up Ivy and said, “sign here, say this.” She ignored all the letters to the appointment board and 2 pending federal lawsuits involving Baldwin County Sheriff Office, BCSO, and their Major Crimes Unit. She ignored the wrongful conviction of Murray Lawrence. She also ignored the clown show case of Steve Nodine which involved the same Prosecutor, Sheriff and Judge involved in the case of Murray Lawrence’s wrongful conviction. Mr. Nodine is lucky he was not wrongfully convicted. Ivy ignored the 10 innocent lives lost, that we know of, in the last 15 years in Baldwin County. People who just happen to come into contact with BCSO and then become victims of the BCSO. Their deaths were justified by the Major Crimes Unit of the Sheriff Department who investigated themselves. No accountability, No transparency, No camera footage, and certainly no justice.

Ivy appointed Anthony Lowery, a carbon copy of Hoss Mack. The good thing is that Hoss Mack is leaving on August 31. Let’s hope the door slams him in the ass as he slithers away. Very little press is following the story and the articles written are only a few paragraphs and all fluff, no substance. I am sure the county commission will have a vanity party for Hoss and like Governor Ivy, they will hold their hands in the air and sing false accolades on Hoss’s departure.

“Baldwin County continues serving its residents, as well as a record number of visitors each year, and we certainly pride ourselves on keeping it a safe place to live, work and visit," Ivey said. “Sheriff Hoss Mack leaves large shoes to fill, but I am confident Anthony is more than prepared to lead." Someone please wake up Governor Ivey, Sheriff Hoss Mack has little feet and he is using them to beat feet out of BCSO, in one hell of a hurry????


Sheriff Lowery will now catch all the bullshit Mack left behind, and it is piled high. He will have no excuse because he was under Mack’s armpit from day one. Two wrongful death federal lawsuits that specifically mention the Baldwin County Major Crimes Unit, have been filed. The writing is on the wall, if the sheriff department continues with the charade of investigating themselves, then they can expect more federal lawsuits.


It will also be interesting how the new Sheriff is going to handle complaints within the BCSO involving sexual relations between officers of the department and subordinates. This also includes extra marital affairs that violate BCSO personal behavior. Kinda like the pot calling the kettle black, wouldn't ya say.

The dirty closet of the sheriff’s office is going to spill out all the unethical behavior under Sheriff Mack. Lowery is going to get the karma Mack deserved. Sheriff Lowery has 2 years before he faces an election. He will be voted out of office.
