 The whole discourse of this blog starts with the individual that publishes these outlandish claims against council members. Paul Frances Ripp or 'administration' sets the tone, anyone can file an ethics complaint, and he loves to do this, but if he was fair he would also 'publish' the results. Anyone can accuse anyone of anything, it is the proving part that makes it hard. 

But I do have proof of the mayor's wrong doing!
