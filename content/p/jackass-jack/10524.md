 30  cases dismissed due to lack of evidence. The claims made under oath do not include anything from press conferences, Republican hearings, etc.  The big evidence is always "on the way". Say it in court or it doesn't mean a thing.  You underestimate how many people wanted Trump out of office and the increase in population. Your feelings don't hold up in court. Do you think Sydney Powell overlooked all the formatting errors, etc in her filing?  Well, if the case was dismissed due to lack of evidence, she could not draw the case out further and collect more fundraising money. She got you all hyped up about "the kraken" which turned out to be nothing of value in court.
