 I have not thrown out one accusation that I can't prove. (go take a peek at Fairhope Uncensored) I have also raised some interesting theories.  And I think the entire issue is that the Mayor has NOT kept her eye on the ball.  She has been too busy with her own personal vendettas to worry about us citizens that she professes to care about so much.  And I personally care if I have a Mayor who has committed fraud (Grand Hotel, misappropriation of funds), alleged assault on an employee, spyware to track confidential information, flat out lying to us, the list goes on. 
Why do you "doubt" they are committing tax fraud?  Because they're so nice to you when you spend money in their store?  Well, you must be one of the lucky ones...
