 That's not the interesting part.  What's interesting is the LLC owns it, the business pays it rent (income) and she uses it as her personal residence. #1 - why is the LLC not listed on her public disclosure form, when she clearly receives income from it (rent)? #2 - Is she declaring the rental equivalent of the residence on her personal income taxes? #3 - As previously asked, what about the utilities?  Does the business foot the bill?  If yes, she needs to declare that as well.
