 I believed that Jack Burrell was a good guy because he was the only City Council member to vote against the Fly Creek Apartments.  Then I later read that he only voted down the apartments b/c he lived in the adjacent neighborhood.  I continued to believe that he cared about the best for the city of Fairhope and that he was in support of our new Mayor.
Never have I been so disappointed.  With Jack's political instincts and Karin's will to clean up Fairhope's sleaze, they could have done great things together.  However, his condescending comments and attitude toward the elected Mayor have exposed him for just another smooth talking good ole boy creep.  I hate it for Fairhope and I hope that we don't let him get away with anything else.
