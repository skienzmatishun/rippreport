 Sad but true.  Government corruption has destroyed what was once a wonderful town. It seems that most of the 'smart money' that is not tied to Fairhope (because of jobs/businesses) is desperately trying to get out now.  I am so torn.  I feel that this is the last time that my home will be worth as much, but I hope for the best.  Someday the Fairhope Museum will have an exhibit that teaches how greedy and incompetent 'Christians' can destroy the quality of life of an entire city within a decade or so.
