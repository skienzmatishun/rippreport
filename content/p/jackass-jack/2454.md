 Mules/donkeys are smarter than horses, mules/donkeys are sure footed. They can carry more weight than a horse, can work harder! Mules/donkeys will not do something stupid, that is why they are considered stubborn. So, if you want to compare Jack to a mule/donkey then you are right. Jack is sure footed, steady, and will not do some stupid like this damn mayor. She is as dumb as the day is long, she is about to expose for what he really is, a buffoon!
