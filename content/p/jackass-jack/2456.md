 I so agree.  This was beyond bizarre. How does Jack have a dog in this fight? If Tripp doesn't care, why does Jack? Was Jack, perhaps, collecting a 'fee' for delivering this contract to his BibleBuddy?    I hope that all attendees/viewers also noted that no one else on the Council supported Jack's tantrum.  Kevin Boone was the first to give support to D&amp;J and the others quickly agreed.  This leads me to believe that our Council is not as corrupt as we believed.  Interesting period in Fairhope's story!  Perhaps Jack is toast when the other members are embarrassed by him?
I appreciate the Ripp Report but am disappointed that it has removed the 'agree/like' feature because it was a built-in city hall.  If I posted something that was overwhelmingly received, I would be forced to re-think my position.  Why has this feedback tool been removed? 
Also, Mayor Wilson contacted Mr Pittman and he chose to not bid.......was Jack supposed to give him the contact without a bid?  I am new to Baldwin County and don't understand this system of taxpayer money going to people only because on their last name.  
Please explain it to me!
