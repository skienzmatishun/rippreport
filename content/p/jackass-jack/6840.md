 They are letting the subdivisions being built uncontrolled - why does not anyone stop this insane growth?  Don't say "It's in the county."  That is bologna!  All a municipality has to do is say "Our sewers cannot handle the new houses," and guess what?  It stops!  
But no, these guys - along with certain county commissioners who have been bought by Truland, DR Horton, and Belaton keep these guys in their pockets.  This is the 700 pound elephant in the room.
Mr. Ripp, where am I wrong on this?  Can you please tell me where I am wrong so I can adjust my thinking?
