 Georgia, I'm glad the like/dislike button is gone and I'll tell you why.  For each up vote, a down vote would take the comment to its original count.  So what would happen is that as soon as a particular post started gaining "points", the Council Clan and their buddies would rally and start hitting down down down, just because they could.  This created a totally inaccurate indicator of public opinion.
