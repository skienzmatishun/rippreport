 How are you privy to the Mayor's tax returns?  I seriously doubt that the Wilson's are committing tax fraud; why would anyone want to stir up such a hornet's nest by throwing around these accusations with clearly no proof?
We need to keep our eye on the ball(s): infrastructure, Fly Creek Apartments, sewage in the Bay, uncontrolled growth that is going to ruin our school system, etc.  If the Mayor stays on her promises, I don't care if she has bodies buried beneath Page &amp; Pallette, and neither should anyone else.
 She does need more experienced assistants, however; the ones that she has are going to be the end of her.  If they are good enough friends, perhaps they will resign because she needs someone with political experience.  Her enemies are not going away and her assistants, while well intentioned, are neither savvy nor dirty enough to play the game that is in process.
