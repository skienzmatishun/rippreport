 Lot of ifs Truth Teller. But one fact for sure. Jack Burrell acted and seemed distraught while accusing Mayor Wilson of not wanting Trip Pittman to get the debri contract. We have all seen his terrible 2 year old fits during these meetings. Congratulations to the 2 Eagle Scouts who where recognized. Just KNOW that they were both taught not to act or represent Fairhope the way Jack Burrell does.
