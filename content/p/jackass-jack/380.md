 Clever way to get the taxpayers to fund their defense attorney under the guise of Airport business.  Absolute incompetence at best, criminal good old boy deal more likely.  We will clean this mess up at the next election, if the US Attorney's Office doesn't do it first. Unacceptable. We voted Wilson in as mayor, not Jack Burrell. The tail trying to wag the dog needs to be stopped.
