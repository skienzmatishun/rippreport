 I agree totally that women are 100% equal to me. But if you are an equal then it should not be a problem to called out or asked someone, male or female to stop talking in a meeting that is not their meeting. If we are all equal then if someone is rude to someone else then it should not be considered sexist.

There can not be a double standard. I have a professional wife, 2 daughters, and I hope they are considered equal but equal means equal. 

By your logic then the whole Council bows to him and they are men, where is your argument?

So you see a group called in Fairhope called 'good-ole-boys unite'?  But you do see 'sister's unite'. Who is being sexist?

I totally disagree with any premise of Jack or other men on the Council are being sexist. What I see is, professionals, politicians arguing and the mayor shoots back and bashes men, I have personally heard her bash men.

Now, get in the kitchen and cook me some dinner!
