 Correct me if I'm wrong.  The airport authority's own secretary won a bid based on airplanes, most of which he doesn't even own, and includes those airplanes in his city fuel use to fluff (falsify) his bid?! He owes the city that full tax amount, I hope it is being collected. This member is not only still on the committee and constructing his building, taxpayers are paying his personal lawyer to defend them all? Am I reading this right? And the airport authority members who awarded the bid to their committee comember are playing the victim. Meanwhile, the city is struggling to pay off millions in debt on airport property that is controlled by... these same guys?
