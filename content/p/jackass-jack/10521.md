 I guess you are one of those people that was talking about. I’m not locking down. I’m just trying to be safe by wearing a mask and practicing social distancing.  I can assure you that I’m working everyday and working on projects that requires me go to different stores and meet in person with people. You miss the point about the health and safety of our citizens.  No matter if the covid is real or fake, I think there is enough evidence that we all should practice safety when it comes to our health. I guess you would bitch about anything though. Keeps you busy huh?
