 IRS has been notified about the mayors business expenses (LLC), taking living expenses as a tax deduction is not legal. AND you can notify the IRS anonymously! Or you can give them your name and it will remain anonymously and you can get up to 10% of recovered tax owned! I am sitting here laughing my ass off too!
