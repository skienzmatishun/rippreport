 Has anyone else wondered what Jack's wife's rich banking banking friends gain from his association with the airport?  Look at his bio on Fairhope's website.  He was a "big fish" in a small town in high school, and used to being the center of attention.  I don't know any professional who lists his high school athletics history as part of what qualifies him/her for a position within town government. He reminds me of that egocentric character, 'Baby Brent' from the kids' movie "Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs".
