 Although I watched the council meeting on Monday, I wanted to re-watch Jack's once-again childish attack on the Mayor for no reason at all but to throw his weight around.  For those who did not hear his belligerent scolding, it begins at 31.28 on the video above.  And what's with Jack's white suit? All he needs is a bolo tie and a white Stetson to complete his ensemble.  Anyway, as expected whenever the Mayor gets "uppity" and fails to "know her place" in the pecking order, he becomes agitated, talking down to her, and finishing up with a variation of his favorite put-down "Mayor, that's enough!". And for what?  Because she calmly explained what he himself did not understand?  Because she didn't stay meek and mild as he whined about some random, unanticipated, hypothetical event that we all know he WISHES would happen so he could then say "I told you so!" I commend the Mayor for not only acting appropriately with these bids but behaving like an adult while Jack once again tried to demean her.  Thank God the council meetings are streamed now so our eyes are open to what really happens.  You go, Mayor. Grow up, Jack.
