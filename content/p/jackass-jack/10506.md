 Mister Ripp,
There is a rumor circulating that since you didn't get the SOS to come down and oversee the election, theft occured. I beleive there was some sort of hanky panky because why would all the council men get in by 200 votes or less and then Mayro Karin lose 65 to 35 to a "woman" with a high school degree? This makes zero sense. Did fairhope use dominion voting machines like the democrats? It is a question worth asking. Voters deserve to know1!
