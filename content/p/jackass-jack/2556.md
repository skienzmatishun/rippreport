 Well. There go the candy ases of the council and they turds. All they can vote on now is on things during the council meeting. Although after talking to a couple of them. The whole council and Trip Pittman would have voted to have Jack Burrell not make the prick that he is comment regarding that she didn't want Pittman to have the debris contact. Jack. Got to give you credit. You don't know when to shut up. Pittman is praying for you and him right now. Both you and Pittman enjoy what little political office time you have left. I can assure everyone, mayor or council supporters. Pittman was done a long time ago and Jackass Boss Hogg. You are history. So nobody really cares about you being an ass. I would think by now that all women of Fairhope have learned that you think they all are way beneath you.
