 We need to do more than just comment on these posts (thank you to the RIPP REPORT for always keeping us informed).  Fairhope residents are needed at the City Council meetings. And not the same 8 - 10 residents who attend every meeting. Fairhope needs a regular appearance of our voting residents to show our position; to show our anger and disgust at Burrell and his utter defiance of ever being wrong or unethical; to show our support for our town and yes to show support for our Mayor. Please meet me at the next City Council meeting. Let's be heard together. Tomorrow the 13th at 6pm.
