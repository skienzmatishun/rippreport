 Question:  What is the difference between a yankee, a sorry yankee, and a damn yankee?
 
Answer:  A yankee is someone from the north.  A sorry yankee is someone from the north and moves down here.  A damn yankee is a yankee who moves down here from the north and brings his or her family and friends.  This is why our roads are so jammed up.  We have sorry and damn yankees driving all over the place.
