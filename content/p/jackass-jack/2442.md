 Very confused, does Jack think that Trip Pittman cannot keep up with the expiration dates of his business's contracts?  Is Jack questioning Tripp's business sense?   Or is the city of Fairhope supposed to do this for him?   If Jack is so concerned why did he not keep with the expiration or extension dates of this contract?
