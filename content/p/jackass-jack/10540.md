 Gunner is a great example of the problem these days.  All he had to do was to search google for something like "johns hopkins covid study deaths".  He would find the explanation for the retraction along with the original article. He then could read the damn article and see that the retraction makes sense and that it doesn't talk about total deaths.  Instead you go to some asshole on tv or the internet and take their word for it.
