 Pittman is not in the business of disaster recovery; he is a full time politician.  He didn't even have time to bid on it; why does Burrell care if Pittman doesn't?  This is bizarre!  And, Truth Teller, Pittman did a half-ass job with the BP clean up so why would Fairhope hire him again for anything?
