 Pittman didn't even put in a bid this time, which made me think that perhaps he is counting on moving to Washington soon and leaving Baldwin County behind.  Jack Burrell's reaction and comments were shocking to me; it was a very unbecoming little tantrum by someone who should have been above such displays of temper. The Mayor did a great job getting this accomplished.
