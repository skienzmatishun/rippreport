 Didn't vote for any currently in office except the two we didn't have a choice. 

People who truly pay attention didn't vote for any of these people either.  Every one in it for personal gain. Sullivan and Jackass are vendictive too. They have a lot of people on their list to screw. Mostly citizens.
