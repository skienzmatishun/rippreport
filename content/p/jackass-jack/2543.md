 I have been reading RR a while but this is my first post. The discourse has become more and more ridiculous almost every week. I am speaking to both sides of the name callers.
Now it also seems to be getting crude. I wonder how many posters are teenagers or younger because I can' imagine grown ups being sonridiculous.

I see plenty of mistakes made by the two main protagonists, Burrell and Wilson, and regret they cannot take some of their banter private and work out some of the problems.

Frankly I think many of our problems began before this last year. The problem with the airport is we tried to be developers and buy lots of adjacent land prior to its significant market drop. Inadequate planning started the Fly Creek fiasco. I don't know if there was corruption/mismanagement with the soccer complex, it just seems way too much money was spent on it.

Let's try to get the conversation cleaner, not meaner.  Vilifying the other side is not convincing anyone and is inaccurate. Neither side has been close to,perfect.
