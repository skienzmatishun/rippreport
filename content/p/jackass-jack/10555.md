 Hey CM, I guess you are an expert?  How did you make it through the swine flu?
WE have 36 schools in The Baldwin County School System. Today, there were 248 absences related to Covid....88 just from Fairhope!  All you idiots that are griping about the lockdown, most people who agree with everyone getting out and enjoying life. There is nothing terrible about wearing a mask and practicing social distancing. You all want to scream at everyone no matter what they believe. STFU!!! You morons are the ones who ruin our city and watch your children grow up to be just like the pricks you are. Mask, social distancing and washing your hands once in a while ain’t gonna kill you. But heck, I forgot y’all think you’re God!  My bad!  Call me when your kid get put in jail or gets his nose punched when he is being a smart ass to someone who won’t put up with his crap.
