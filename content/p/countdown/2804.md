 Oh yeah. Sure Lane McGowan! Trip Pittman is legit all right. Suckerd us about being an oil recovery contractor and then left all the Boom anchors out in the Bay "after he was paid already to remove them".  Legit contractor means doing everything the contract says to do especially when you get paid to do it. Lies everytime he opens his mouth. While there are a few around that know how to stop it. He won't be getting all the heavy equipment contracts because we are going to punish those who give any contracts to Trip Pittman for heavy equipment contract or for any contract for that matter. Government or corporate. We the people who have been bent over by Trip Pittman is now going to have our turn. Get you pencils out other heavy, light or medium equipment companies. Very soon it will be your turn to not only get more contracts but some of the ones you have been screwed out of especially some of the municipality's contracts that were letting Pittman know what you all were bidding.
