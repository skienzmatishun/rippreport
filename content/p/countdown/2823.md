 I get it that many of the city council votes are routine or obvious to normal people but I think it is unhealthy that the three who attend the same church have voted as a block on every single vote this year. It allows a small group to dominate the agenda. I have other problems with these and other members but Fairhope is too large to have a majority of the council all members of the same group. Not knocking the church, but given the bloc voting I think it's a problem.
