 She is definitely her own worst enemy (if one does not count her loyal 'besties'); however, I still believe that she is trying to do a good job.  If Botox and Maser would resign and she were to hire experienced staff, I believe that she could truly do something good for Fairhope.  She seems to be trapped in a 7th grade slumber party and can't seem to get out of it....I feel sorry for her lately.
