 Oh!  Is that what you meant about poor staffing?  My apologies for disagreeing with you.  I agree that getting rid of Botox (she does not even have a college degree) and Maser (know virtually nothing about her) would be a great start.  I think her intentions are in the right place, wanting to protect and preserve the city we all love, but she can't seem to get out of her own way, and has been too distracted by all the other issues that have come of her lack of experience.
