 What type of 'professional' is Maser supposed to be?  I haven't heard of any type of high level corporate or government experience.  I did hear her rattle on at a Council Work Session about how she contacted dozens of marinas around the country and was advised that Fairhope should run its own rather than leasing it out.  The woman appears to be able to make a simple phone call and take a survey but she has not displayed any critical thinking skills. Comparing most of these marinas was akin to comparing apples and coconuts.  Karin needs to cut her loose fast.
