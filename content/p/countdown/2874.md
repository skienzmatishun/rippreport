 You should be standing behind a Christian if you were truly true Christians that have a Prayer Group. Having a Prayer Group and standing behind a known thief that took advantage of taking money for something he didn't do makes your Prayer Group null and void. You should pray for him to be a better person and then maybe add things to it little by little. Anyone that takes money for a job that was not completed and polluted our bays on purpose by leaving the BP anchors to hurt our waterways for us, our children and our grandkids. I pray that you won't be so disappointed when Trip Pittman loses by a huge margin.
