 Why are you copying the "time off" answer?  I've been reading about all these things that are getting posted several times but I couldn't help see that you also said you took 3 days off after someone posted the were going to be gone for the weekend. Makes no sense. What does it matter. Stick to the article and quit falling for all these people traps. It makes us all look stupid. Tell us who's going to be out next US Senator or do some of these candidates deserve to be candidates in the first place. Or even the next Alabama state senator. Tell us what you think besides falling for all this stuff and blaming other people for playing games. They do it to really make you look stupid and I don't see a single trap that you haven't stuck your foot in yet. Christ oh mighty!!!!
