 Georgia - I often agree with your opinions, but this time I think you are  wrong. Yes, she is very inexperienced politically, and she continues to reaffirm that on a daily basis.  However, I think your statement is a major insult to the former City Treasurer, Tanner Bonner, Jennifer Fiddler and Sherry Sullivan. They were hard working, dedicated, talented employees, and the City is suffering their loss.
