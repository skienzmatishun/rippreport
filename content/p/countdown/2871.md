 You got us all beat for the rambling award. Nothing Again to do with the current subject. Jeff Sessions and Kay Ivy looking alike is just another one of one of your typical insane remarks. Just remember the word typical jackass. I don't think people are going to continue to put up with you much longer. You and Truth Teller had nothing positive to this site. Only confusion, hatred and distractions regarding the different subject that are written about each week. Jester centainly means fool and Tuth Teller has followed your lead and is just as much of a fool as you are now. I've warned the both of you for weeks and Jester for months.  It's y'all badgering the Mayor constantly every on every Article so matter what the subject is about. I would quickly start my own blog. Just saying!
