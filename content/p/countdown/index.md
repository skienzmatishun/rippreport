Congressman Mo Brooks:

## Brooks: If Sessions fired, I'll give up seat - CNN Video

Congressman Mo Brooks (R-AL) said he will give up his candidacy for the Senate and calls for other candidates to drop out of the race if President Trump fires US Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

Sen Trip Pittman:

The first three selections are a NO, Pittman is a HELL NO, He is the WORST elected official in Baldwin County, by a long shot.

The only other person who is active in the race on the republican side is Dr. Randy Brinson.

Are you not tired of the same old BS from career politicians or politicians that use their office for personal gain, like Pittman? Well your alternative may be Mr. Brinson. He may not be well known and certainly is not a career politician but would be a breath of fresh air compared to the above.

Please vote in the primary and think carefully who you want as Alabama’s next US Senator. Be careful you do not send a swamp rat to the swamp.
