 Francis, I want to make a proposal to you - I will be the editor on the Wonderful Wednesday once a month, but I will change that edition's name to Jester's Court. My edition will be published once a month and we will bring back voting. Witnesses can submit evidence, people can vote on the issue at hand then I will issue a ruling at the end before the next Freaky Friday Edition! It's a hell,ve' idea, so what do you think little buddy?
