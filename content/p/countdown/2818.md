 Georgia, look at her shady past. Look into her 'foundations' that had to merged, there she and Botox on the foundation. Look at other issues, she makes all of these statements about how she has given back but just look deep at how she operates. Inexperience is different from lacking character or perpetrating a fraud. Claim up to 30,000 ft and look down, look at all that has happened then listen to her explanations. Georgia, you have been very objective on here, but you need to look at the pattern and practice from years before she became mayor up until now. It is not all the mayor's fault it is the folks she listens too. Ripp when you are going to become a real reporter and start reporting the truth?
