 Wait, Birmingham has been doing what for years??? You did not address the issue of Spygate with the City Treasure! And why do you always try and compare Fairhope to Montgomery, Mobile or Birmingham? You are not answering the question, trying to spin it again. Answer the one question - do you think the mayor did anything wrong by placing the tracking software on the city treasurer computer? IF not why?

ALSO, you have been silent about Jester writing an edition! It is a fair offer! (Post 8/5/2017 at 5:25 PM)
