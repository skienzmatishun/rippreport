 It is very clear that I have struck a nerve about all of the mayor's misdeeds. If I did not call out the mayor everyone on this board would give her a pass! She has no morals, lies with impunity, has all these ideas with no way to pay. So you seem to like a mayor that carries out a fraud for years at the club, you like a mayor that fires folks and lies about it, then looks for a reason why. You like a mayor that spies on employees, creates a hostile work environment, a mayor that assaults employees! The list goes on and on. You wait, the mayor is going to pay a heavy price for her misdeeds. You are just as low as she is, you are a damn fool. 

I don't give a Ripp what you think!!!!
