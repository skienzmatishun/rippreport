 Fly Creek - Mayor for political reasons/City Council for legal issues/No Fly Creek Apartments if possible.
Moratorium - Both Side/Need growth but controlled/Wayne is great.
Hiring Freeze - City Council.
Budget Items - City Council.
Airport Board - Mayor/her right to name but City Council gets to confirm/Compromise. 
Coming Up: Marina - Limit city involvement/Keep it leased. 
New Budget - Tighten but increase mayor's salary and up the city council fees/Both are paid too little for the work required.
General City Government loses money - but it all comes from one pot. If an increase in taxes outside of city limits, then decrease utility bills, do use the excess money from utilities to pay for other ideas reinvest all monies into infrastructure.
Allow for more private/government projects/limit government involvement. 
We are all from a small town, going to same church is like saying they all eat at the same Restuarant or go to the same bookstore to drink coffee together so they vote the same. 3 do not block, all 5 have blocked or 4 out 5 have blocked.
