 Damn, that was the most babbling rant ever! Well, maybe close to the one Francis posted a few months back when he went over the edge. AND Who are you to place yourself in the position to forgive anyone? You can look into anyone's heart to know what they think! So you are without sin, I can clearly see this! Saying that State Senator Pittman or anyone else has earned a one-way ticket to hell is absurd!  You need to forgive yourself, and may God forgive you for all of your sins! Hey, you ever noticed how Governor Ivy looks like Jeff Sessions twin sister? Look at them side by side, they look like they are brother and sister!
