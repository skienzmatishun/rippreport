 That's the most hilarious post I have seen by Jester Triple-Six. Jester telling someone else to forgive and even bring up GOD!  Jester, you are certainly one person that will never have the right to tell someone that they shoul ask for forgiveness. You certainly don't have any right to post GOD in any of your pathetic posts. You are a heathen and much more closer to the devil without being and posting as a hypocrite.  Be off with you!
