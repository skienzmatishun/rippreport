 He goes to that same church, right ?  Here are the controversial votes this year in my mind:!
Fly Creek    I am with the Mayor
Moratorium.  Both sides for it
Hiring Freeze. With the council
Budget items:  I am generally with the council
Airport Board: with the Mayor

Coming up: Control of the Marina

I think council undecided, but I am against Mayor and them also if they want the City to run everything. Maybe a middle ground will develop.
