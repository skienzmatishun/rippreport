 Wouldn’t it be nice just to have had a resident qualication all these years, requiring you to have had residency for a minimum of 10 years if you were 30 years or older. I know that I wouldn’t get half as much spit on me while sitting close to Jack Burrell when he is drunk downtown. Mississippi boy came in here, and is the town drunk and woman bullyier. I guess some if you women like that. Never been around a gentleman!  Sorry, I know some of you women would knock him on his butt. Things could be so different. Nice and quiet. Oh, also if your name started with Robert or ended with Brown, you would never meet qualifications javing  that name. And ole Jackass to the far left of Jack. No jackasses can qualify either. That alone would slim done most of the men or women who could qualify.  Be a great City!  Fairhope’s citizens better keep up.
