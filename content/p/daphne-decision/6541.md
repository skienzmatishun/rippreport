 More and more people are becoming aware of the Baldwin County  political machine known as Catalyst.   As candidates have to answer if they are part of the Catslyst group or not, we will see these candidates openly affirm their support for Catalyst or openly oppose Catslyst.
This will lead to factions in the county Republican Party.  Just last election I saw where candidates would say they were not Catalyst.   Those who were Catalyst got defensive.
Maybe Catalyst will change its name next election to hide itself.   If so, one can tell who it is by following the money.  Watch for contributions by real estate PACs, donations by that private university in OB, VolkertPAC, and money from developers who are responsible for these megasubdivisions.
This money trail will lead you to the political machine- whatever itâ€™s name is or will be...
