 You what do you mean “WANT” control of Baldwin County.  Catalyst HAS control of Baldwin County
Who is surprised that the Daphne Council, controlled by Catalyst, will pick Armstrong?
He lives in that district and has carried their water for years.  Armstrong knows what side of his bread is buttered and who has been buttering it since he dropped in here from Dothan years ago.
