Fairhope’s CATALYST group is licking their wounds after the election of Jerry Carl. What is important is the major shift in voting away from CATALYST candidates. Carl’s opponent “Lowtower” made a major mistake by hooking up with CATALYST, aka Scott Boone Consultant.

A statistical analysis of the, district, First Congressional Seat, Jerry Carl, shows as much as a 2500 votes being shifted from CATALYST Lowtower to Carl. That is from the primary to the runoff. Looking even closer at Baldwin County, for both races, it shows a swing of 2652 Catalyst votes from Lowtower to Carl.

Dig deeper, in Fairhope, same elections, CATALYST, lost votes to Carl, were around 1118. To be sure Carl did not win Fairhope however he gained considerable ground from CATALYST. An estimate of gained votes for Carl from CATALYST in Baldwin County would be approximately 2000 to 2500 votes. Those gained votes helped Carl, from some votes he lost in the rural counties.

Mobile pushed Carl over the top to win by 3873. Baldwin County be proud, VOTERS, prevented a CATALYST candidate from going to the swamp. Special thanks to: [BALDWIN COUNTY CITIZENS For GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY (CGA) Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1593293237549165/?ref=group_header)

CATALYST can change it’s name to Scott Boone Consulting but Baldwin County voters have awaken to the fact that nothing good comes from CATALYST or SBC.

Fairhope, home base of CATALYST, is reeling from the loss of the Congressional seat and are worried about the CATALYST council not being re-elected. They are scurrying around like rats trying to figure how to hold on to the council and defeat the Mayor.

Believe it or not I have heard Cant, former corrupt mayor, aka the father of Fairhope's infrastructure and sewer issues, was going to run for a council seat, who’s seat will be very interesting but I would guess Jay Robinson or Jimmy Conyers. If Fairhope falls for this stunt they will forever forget it.

CATALYST was planning on jumping on John Melones paddle board for Mayor. Now they are not confident that John’s BP credentials and lackadaisical manner will succeed.

CATALYST has gone back to the drawing board,bleeding from their loss, trying to decide their next move.

Tip to the Rippster, said that CATALYST has talked Sherry Sullivan into falling on the sword for the status quo. This surprises me as earlier information had Sullivan saying hell no. She has a higher paying job than the Mayor’s salary and Sherry has some serious baggage, that will be opened, publicly! On top of that the city employees do not want her back as an employee much less Mayor.

Let’s hope Sherry remembers what happened to Chief Pettis, CATALYST stabbed him in the back.

Watch for Jay Robinson, who is not running for his council seat, help Sherry fall on the sword.

The three B’s, Boone Brown and Burrell look like they will have opponents. The B’s should be top priority to vote OUT>
