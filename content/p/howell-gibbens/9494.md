 Mr. Ripp, no doubt that there is little class concerning this Howling fellow. Just pick up the phone and call anyone where he has worked. He’s a “Self Serving Douche Bag” is the answer I got from 3 out of 4 people who worked with him. Also, can you please explain in a little more detail about what exactly does the figure $17,500 represents concerning the Fairhope Coincil voting themselves a raise and also Health Insurance Benefits?  Is that total for the council each year or is in fact, that amount for each person which would be quite a sum annually?  What’s the total bill PER YEAR  just for the total additional monies of all Council members  increase for insurance and raises combined? Thank you in advance for your response.
