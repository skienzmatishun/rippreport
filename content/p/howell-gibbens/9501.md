 They did not "vote themselves" insurance benefits. The benefits have been in place since the 90's. They voted to continue them as they stood. Fairhope self insures, the $ goes into a pool. If an employee does not get sick or need medical care, the $ stays in the pool. The "reported" amounts for the council's insurance have been highly exaggerated. But that's not surprising. Also - the mayor gets the same insurance, and has voted in a raise to double the mayor's salary, whoever that may be come august.
