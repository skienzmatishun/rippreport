 Alabama is and has been subsidized by the north for many years.  The low taxes only makes Alabama dependent on the federal government.  One of the most dependent states in the country along with many other red states. Enjoy your trailer park highschools. If not for the federal government, there would be literal starvation in Alabama.  The yankees pull in the money, the red states take it.
