 AND your point is? Are you one of the families that have lived here for generations? Or are you one of those that is de-novo families that want to shut the door behind themselves once the arrive.

There are a lot of folks that support Boone and Burell, so much ss that Jack received more votes than the mayor. 

Most need to come to the understanding that there is a council for a reason, think about it for a minute if the mayor could do everything she wanted this city could possible change total direction every four years! Each time a new mayor was elected then the city change direction.

So you like to name call Kevin and Jack, but if someone calls the mayor Karzy Karin then everyone blows up. Why is it okay to insult these fellows and yet it is sexism to insult the mayor? 

I really don't think folks fully understand the real issues the city faces, even the mayor does not know the issues, she thinks she knows but doesn't read the ordinances about impact fees! She needs to become more intelligently curious, she is social, not intelligently curious.
