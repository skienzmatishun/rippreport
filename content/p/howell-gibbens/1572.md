 And just what does how long you have lived in Baldwin County or Fairhope have to do with anything. Would you please inform all how long one must live in Baldwin Co. before he/she is able to offer an opinion or suggestion. It appears the various political and business interests are encouraging growth and you can't have growth without new people.  I suppose newcomers are to just move here, spend money and keep their mouth shut.  Sounds like a plan by the Good Ole Boys.
