 I'm not 100% familiar. Fill me in. Who's plane was it? Were they involved in that bidding process that seems awfully suspect? That's important because the airport serves few and takes up much of the budget. Do medical  helicopters do something to that effect? Is there some medical helicopter investigation you have going? The Ripp Report doesn't seem to be preventing you from posting it.
