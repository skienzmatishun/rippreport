 Oh stop splitting hairs, "Truth Teller."  I was there that very night when they voted for the insurance.  They knew what they were doing.  Again, many city employees still cannot get that Cadillac insurance, but the council members made sure they themselves could.
One council member tried to justify their vote by saying they love to serve but they need the insurance.
You must be a lackey for Elliot, Haygood, &amp; Stacey, or Catalyst, or Scott Boone Consulting, or whatever the crooks are calling it these days.  What ever it is called on any day, Catalyst is just a bunch of developers buying off politicians and forming a cliche where they approve overgrowth at the cost of the residents.
Now go sell your propaganda and damage control elsewhere.  We know better becuase we have seen you all in action.
