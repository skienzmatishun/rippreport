 Vote catalyst candidates out and prevent new catalyst candidate Sherry from getting in.

Otherwise, Fairhope will be sold out to developers. Get the facts. Sherry and current council represent Catalyst!

Ask Sherry and see if she lies.  Councilman Kevin Boone started Catalyst and now his son, Scott, is running it. 

You will see a whole slate of signs together. BOONE, BURRELL, BROWN and SHERRY. Total corruption to the core.
