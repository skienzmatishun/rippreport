 Fairhope is getting the leadership it voted in. 

Queen Sherry is spreading her love and public relations all around the town. The lighting of the trees must go on so she can hand out Fairhope Ho Ho Ho Stuff. Wondering who owns the company that printed that promotional junk? Wondering who is profiting?   
Sherry is like a grown up homecoming Queen and about that mature. This is what the voters wanted an Overgrown cheerleader/homecoming Queen and her star players as team mates. 
If Karinâ€™s beachfront grant was so distasteful, and destructive to the bluffs and bay front, they should return the tainted money. If the engineers are so inept, they should follow the plans of their high school grad Mayor and run things the way they did in the past. RobinHood Style. 

Looks like people would learn from the past!!
