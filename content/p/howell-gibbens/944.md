 Jack Burrell did not run against the Mayor.  He ran against someone who had only recently moved here and was rumored to have been financed by Tim Kant. To state that Burrell received more votes than Wilson is similar to saying that the Giants scored more points than the Saints when they were not playing against each other.  Jack Burrell was the first who stated this and he became the joke of Fairhope.......is that you, Jack?
