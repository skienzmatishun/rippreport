 Is she the only business in Fairhope that gets free wifi?  I have noticed that it seldom works anyplace downtown.    Does Panini Pete have to pay for his?  This  is HUGE if the bookstore is the only place that gets it for free. Please provide more details!    I have had a tough time logging in to it at the Local and at Greers........who knew that the Mayor was stealing it for herself??????
