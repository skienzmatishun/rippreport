 We KNOW that Jerry Carl is not Catalyst.  Mannelos is just a faux candidate to split the vote to force a run off.
Nice try, Catalyst, but could you step out of your stupid complacency and try just a wee bit harder? 
See?  We are figuring out your game.  Go ahead and keep trying to play Ripp off as a lunatic.  You all just cannot gt over the fact that people are waking up to your corruption and back room deals.  Your days in office are numbered.  
Now go and throw up some more PVC signs and better yet, see if you can get Chuckie Cheese and Sullivan to put out some more "Baldwin Insider" articles.  That should do the trick.
