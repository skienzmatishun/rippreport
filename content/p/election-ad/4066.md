 I imagine Ripp's lawsuit against Jack is the beginning of the end for the MS boy running things. I hear there are other things brewing and that Jack will likely have to resign as a result. Jack is under tremendous pressure because the goobers on one side want him out as he is no use to them and now he has Ripp crushing him from the other side. Does the mayor get to appoint someone when Jack resigns?
