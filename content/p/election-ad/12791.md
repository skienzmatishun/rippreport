 You said it.  The press couldn't find the pack of elephants because the press is too busy selling ads to Shoe Station.  Hey Mobile Prejudice Register - I am referring to YOU.
I walk by your newspaper racks to see what news you deem to fit to print.  No, I don't buy your (cough) "publication. I saw the diamond pattern on 181 and a few failed attempts at you all trying to be reflective on some made up stories.  You guys are a joke.  To think that at one time this paper was rated the top newspaper in Alabama and is now a bi-weekly tabloid that makes the National Inquirer a better rag.
