 Ripp, we know of the corruption but the politicians cover each other. With the exception of the Lagniappe, the rest of the "press" is weak.  No more investigative journalism can be found around here nor just about anywhere else.  The media is too bottom line driven and we have lazy journalists.  Whenever you want to report the story, the reporters want you to email them a "press release" so they can cut and paste it into a story and not have to think of writing their own reports.  It is lazy and shameful.
If anybody who is a "journalist" out there, I dare you to refute my claims - that is if it is not too hard for you.
