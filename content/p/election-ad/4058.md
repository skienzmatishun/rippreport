 This airport authority has gotten more of my attention.  I was surprised at first about visceral the reaction as been to appointments to the authority.  I also remember it was agreed that the mayor would be allowed to make this next appointment WHEN a term was completed.  Well she got voted down. My analysis:  Conyers voted with the mayor the first time and maintained his vote. Brown grudgingly promised to vote with the mayor and kept his promise. Robinson flipped and gave (I guess) a sincere rationale that everyone wanted him to do so. Boone, who has no obvious dog in the airport "hunt" ,voted against it  -as far as I can tell- because the mayor was for it.. Burrell voted to keep the mayor from encroaching on his turf. At this point I have to wonder why he is so unhinged about a simple appointment to the AA.  I can see a logical reason why everyone voted how they did even though I disagree but Burrell's demeanor makes me wonder. You would think they were voting to send his kids to prison. There must be something going on which is not generally known or he is more socially awkward than I thought.
