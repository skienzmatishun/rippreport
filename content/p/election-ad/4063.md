 Jack received more votes than the Mayor because he was running against a woman who was new to Fairhope and had few friends and even less political support.  He had no real opponent so, of course, he won in a landslide.  I have heard that she was a ringer provided by Kant to make Jack look good.......no idea if that is a fact.  However,
Karin Wilson ran against the LONG term mayor Kant and won, not by a landslide, but she won.

Those who compare their respective vote counts are pretty much comparing apples to snow skis!

The current Council works against the Mayor and the City constantly.  I am not saying that Wilson is always correct but it is their job to work together to protect the City; I believe that she is trying and they are just blindly following Burrell.    In the next election, hopefully all will be replaced......Jack Burrell is a cancer destroying Fairhope and would resign if he had any integrity whatsoever.  I would love to know why Brown, Conyers and Robinson want to die on Jack's Hill!
