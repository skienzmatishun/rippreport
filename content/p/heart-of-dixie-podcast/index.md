Whitney Scapecchi of the Southern Freedom Press joins Harry Still, Francis Paul Ripp, Brandon Moseley, and Brown G Linder III PE Esq to discuss the arrest, incarceration, attempted involuntary commitment to a mental institution, on the word of Bay Minette City Councilman Matthew Franklin.  You can listen and decide who was assaulted.  Whitney has an unflattering email that was leaked to her from inside the BCSO that she shares with the audience. And be sure to file an Open Records Act request to find out what information is in the Master Name Index about you.  They build the database from the information that you gave them in return for a pistol permit.

>Whitney Scapecchi ⚠️ Disclaimer: The audio from this incident contains graphic language. Viewer discretion is advised. I pulled together the original WKRG Channel 5 coverage, the newly released audio from that day, and the context Harry Still recorded as it happened. This gives the public a clear look at what was said, how the situation unfolded, and why it matters. In the newly leaked audio, you can clearly hear Councilman Matt Franklin threatening to kill Harry and his dog. The narrative the public was fed — included repeated “stomping.” Listening to the audio, that’s not the sort of physical contact I gathered was happening. The Mayor also references Harry’s past “political attacks,” which fall under protected speech. No previous records of physical attacks exist and in my own research into Harry’s past prior to today’s podcast show an attorney who touched on political corruption and fought for political transparency — something many responsible citizens engage in. On the heels of this incident, political “attacks” spins a narrative of a deranged and violent individual. It’s important to understand that while Harry was arrested that day, no charges were filed. I also included my initial reaction and a note about a BCSO source who contacted me this morning. That tip involved an internal email showing Sheriff Anthony Lowery directing deputies to pre-target attorney Harry Still at a Republican event. He told them to pull Harry’s jail log photo and “do what you need to do,” even though Harry had only been arrested, not convicted in the prior incident Involving the councilman. That can be considered viewpoint-based policing and potential First Amendment retaliation. It also raises serious concerns under [18 U.S.C. § 242](https://www.google.com/search?q=18+U.S.C.+%C2%A7+242&sca_esv=aaa09739d5691e40&ei=4I0gacn9MfO9p84P5-7ugQM&ved=0ahUKEwjJ7Y7nz4ORAxXz3skDHWe3OzAQ4dUDCBE&uact=5&oq=18+U.S.C.+%C2%A7+242&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiEDE4IFUuUy5DLiDCpyAyNDIyCxAAGIAEGJECGIoFMgUQABiABDILEAAYgAQYkQIYigUyCxAAGIAEGJECGIoFMgsQABiABBiRAhiKBTIFEAAYgAQyBRAAGIAEMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyBRAAGIAESLUGULADWLADcAF4AZABAJgByAGgAcgBqgEDMi0xuAEDyAEA-AEBmAICoAL4AcICChAAGLADGNYEGEeYAwCIBgGQBgiSBwUxLjAuMaAHzguyBwMyLTG4B8wBwgcHMi0xLjAuMcgHGA&sclient=gws-wiz-serp) and Alabama’s [abuse-of-office laws](https://www.google.com/search?q=18+U.S.C.+%C2%A7+242+and+Alabama%E2%80%99s+abuse-of-office+laws).
