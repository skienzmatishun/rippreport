 Ripp, get your facts straight before you start with the propaganda! You are truly the CNN of Fairhope! It wasn’t at the councilman’s house! So by your logic if kids were there and not drinking or doing anything wrong, arrest them? Makes sense! If Jack was at GSB and not at the party nor had any knowledge of the party, he should be arrested? Again, makes sense! If you’re going to put something out there and go as far as calling the news to report the story - get you facts straight!!!
