 So the party was Saturday night and not Friday night?  So much confusion here.  I will stay tuned because a Saturday night party there when the 'rents were out for a Ball would make sense, whereas the original story here made very little sense.
Clearly, no one is stating definitively that the party was the the Burrell home (and I am sure that the 'rents were not happy if it was).  Teenagers all do this and we need to be grateful that no one was hurt......I am no fan of Jack Burrell but this is not something that should be in the media or blogs or whomever should discuss.......his kids have a right to be kids and (if the party was at his house) he is probably grounded for a bit.  Again, one way or another, who has not had or anticipates having a teen host a party when his/her parents are going to be out late?
