 I know for a fact that the Grand Summer Ball was Saturday night because I was there.  If the Burrell kids had a party on Saturday night when their parents were not home (and haven't we all been there/done that/and are so happy that no one was hurt), that is one thing, but I think that it's even more important now to not confuse the public as to the facts.  
You implied that the Bayside Academy/Fairhope High blowout with alcohol and weed was Friday night at the Burrell home, but I would bet that the Burrell parents were NOT out late Friday b/c they were at the GSB Saturday night.  Every false story sets back your goal by a lot, which is probably why there is no police report from that night.  Sloppy reporting hurts your cause (which is just).  Jack can certainly be a jackass but he is neither a sociopath nor  stupid and he would never allow his kids to have a drinking/drugging blowout when he and his wife are absent (OR AT HOME).
Please clarify dates so that everyone has the facts. 
Thanks.
