 Ripp, Ripp, Ripp,
Nothing will come of this - some people are just untouchable.
Don't hold your breath on any resignations.  There has been instituted an upper class royalty here in Fairhope where the law applies to most but not to a selected few.
What gets me mad is that the police are beginning to think we citizens are just lowly serfs in their kingdom.  
I use to respect the police but now they are just another revenue source for the city - tickets, court costs, and other "administrative fees" that can be tacked on to bleed the people dry.
Heck years ago, the police use to interact with the citizens and I knew all of them by their first names.  Today they just ride around in their big SUV's looking to write a ticket for the judge to fine and the city to collect.  We taxpayers fund this lunacy.
