 What I heard him say is that the police are just to be another revenue source for the city and the judge to be the one who marks the prices. This is why people do not like the police because they just want to write tickets and do revenue enhancing things rather than to PROTECT AND TO SERVE
God, this town is really f*cked up!
I hope the city gets sued for civil rights violations.  WHO THE HELL IS BURRELL TO SAY SOMETHING LIKE THIS?  I am a property owning citizen here NOT A TENNANT!
