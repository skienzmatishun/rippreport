RAYMOND WATKINS

Carolyn, Mariah and I, as well as a few hundred other people, are saddened by the news of a very dear friend’s passing. Raymond Watkins, he was one of a kind and I for one will smile every time I think of Raymond. In our yard we have several mementos from Raymond, Plants, rocks and stain glass to mention a few. Raymond and Carolyn had a special bond that few friends ever have. Raymond has known Mariah all her life, she would not want me to say how long that was. Raymond always treated Mariah with respect and love. Alejandro, Mariah’s husband, quickly became friends with Raymond who constantly teased him. Who did he not provoke with his witty teasing? We all know how he took care of Ben and keep him out of any “senior citizens homes”. Raymond also took care of me after multiple shoulder operations at the Birmingham VA. We love you Raymond and we will miss you but we will smile when we think of you. GOD BLESS.
