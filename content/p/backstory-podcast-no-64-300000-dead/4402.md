 I think that the Mayor feels good about his hire b/c it appears that Fairhope's police chief is far too close to Burrell, Boone &amp; Brown.  In my (admittedly, on the 'outside') opinion, Chief Petties is quoted frequently in Burrell's blog, Gulf Coast News Today, questioning Mayor Wilson's decisions and backing up any absurd theory presented by the 3 B's.   I don't believe that the Mayor is always right, but she is not 'on the take'.  I am wondering if Chief Petties is also owned by the B's and the previous mayor.  I hope that I am wrong, but Fairhope has serious issues now and they were NOT caused by Mayor Wilson.  
People are really beginning to finally get a clue about our Council.
You can scream all day long about this 'position that she created' but, if you actually live here, you should be screaming about what our Council has NOT done to repair the antiquated sewer system.  They are making noise to distract from their total ineptitude.
