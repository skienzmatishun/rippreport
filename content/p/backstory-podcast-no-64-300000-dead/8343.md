 But Christian Conservatives sell here.  It is about who can be more like Trump and be more like Jesus than the other candidates.
Catalyst Polling and their developer money bags tell their candidates to say they are the "Conservative Jesus" because this is like catnip to the electorate down here in South Alabama.
This is a sad commentary on the electorate.  Nevermind that these candidates work for the subdivision builders - just remember that they go to church and like Trump.
Hey, I like Trump and go to church - but I don't use it as a way to get elected.
