 Laura, 
First it is "Inquiring" minds..
Second, the election in 2016 was overseen by the Secretary of State and prevented Catalyst form rigging the election.
As Catalyst gets more exposed, watch this group try other shady deals like they already have in shutting down polling places in minority districts in Daphne, and allowing only ONE election booth to poll for district places in Fairhope the last election.
Also, watch Catalyst change its name and "go to ground" now that Stacy is gone, Haygood is running Daphne (in the ground, I might add) and Elliot is off to bigger things.
I am watching the Hightower race. This race will either place Catalyst at the NATIONAL level or provide a stop to Catalyst's bad ways.
