75,179,000 SARS-COV-2 cases confirmed Worldwide with 1,667,000 deaths. The USA this week marks the grim milestone of 300,000 dead and more than 17,256,000 confirmed cases. Alabama Governor Kay Ivey extended the mask order for 6 more weeks.

Huge hack this week that Trump has said mum about, more than likely Russia. Some Lagniappe stories to warm your soul. A lynching memorial to be added at the Baldwin County Courthouse.

Columbia, Alabama corruption, illegal wine at the Sewer Plant, and much more.
