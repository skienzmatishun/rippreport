 He wont go to prison.  There are too many people that are either corrupt themselves that will make money off this deal.  The rest of the people in town just don't care and are too busy doing their own thing.  
You see? Crookedness and apathy are all these guys need to do as they please and get away with it. 
By the way, STOP talking about the FBI in town.  The FBI will not find anything that will make a difference.  I have watched this town turn crooked over the past twelve years - this time matches up right after Katrina hit and outsiders such as Dorsey, Haygood, and Burrell came here and started their crooked schemes.

We got Dorsey out (maybe too late) and now it is time to get Haygood out and Burrell out and send them back to where they came from before they finish ruining the place.
