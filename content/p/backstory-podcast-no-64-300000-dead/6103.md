 If the City Council decides  during a hurricane watch, to vote for something that is not currently critical, I doubt that it will survive any challenge.   Jack Burrell may believe that he can get away with this, but I trust that even Robert Brown won't  go with this one; this may be a  bridge too far (even for Jack's dog).
