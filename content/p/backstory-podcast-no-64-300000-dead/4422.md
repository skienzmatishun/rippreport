 Real leaders do not let others guide them to do something that could shed them in a bad light. Leaders must remember, 1/3 are totally for them, 1/3 is totally against them, and 1/3 is neutral. The leader must come to understand it is the 1/3 that is neutral are the ones they must convince by showing they are a leader. This is not a man verse woman issue, a leader does not ever do anything that may seem nefarious, that is why they are the leader of the city. The mayor has [A] real bad advisor and must distance herself from that advisor.
