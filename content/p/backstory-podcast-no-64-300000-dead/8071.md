 Paul, I watched the podcast and heard your concerns with the “judge” (cough) and his conflict of interest.  It disappoints me to see all this going on.
I am remembering all this when I vote next year
In addition so will do many more people who have seen the misbehavior of this council
They have caused much damage to this town
City Council members: take heed
