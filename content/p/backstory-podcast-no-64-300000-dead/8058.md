 Mr. Ripp I admire your efforts. Been watching you for years.
Understand that the city council members in Fairhope are in involved in multiple land and development deals with catalyst i.e. the city judge investment group.
Enough deals have already been cut to ruin the quality of life of the eastern shore. If the current council against their better judgement decides to run for re-election a little investigating will reveal their many conflicts...and of course the fact that they are lying, greedy and complicit in destroying one of Alabama's prettiest places for profit.
