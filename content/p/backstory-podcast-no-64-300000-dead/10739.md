 I don't think Ripp is all that liberal.  I think he is more of a moderate.  I am a conservative myself but when I see how the local so-called conservative politicians act, I winder how they can get away with calling themselves Republicans.
I believe that they are really opportunists who use the Republican badge to provide cover from the voters.  They are really real estate people that worship the dollar and would sell their souls if their souls were worth anything.  Catalyst politicians tried to sell their souls to Satan and even Satan did not want them.
