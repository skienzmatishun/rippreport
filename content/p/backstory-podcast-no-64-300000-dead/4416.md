 Police chief when he was under Kant's control as flat foot, lied in court over property stolen from me due to personal conflict with Kant. Then he lied about Arbor Gates shooting spree 7/5/17. That was revealed to public 7/15/17 via ticked family member over non reporting of parents apt being shot to pieces and reported by news media. Mayor sent me confirmation email of shooting 7/8. Council chair Burrell ignored. Other council members advised, said nothing when I showed them documentation of shooting and lie. Ok for police chief to lie to public and council to back him up. Doubt his letter in protest of new hire was initiated by him. Not a reflection on our other boys in blue by any means. "Men" in power most corrupt group of "men" front and center ever in Fairhope with exception of past 2 male mayors
