 When you say COVID deaths are these people who died of COVID or those who died with COVID?
The death rate has been inflated.   Hospitals will
report a death of someone who got hit by a bus with COVID and say that It was a COVID death
The schools have been open for a month and where are the sick and dying children?   Huh?
Also Florida has lifted all COVID restraints and the mainstream media was just waiting for an uptick
Quarantine the weak.    Otherwise let Darwinism solve this problem
If you are in a susceptible category due to COVID then quarantine yourself
Yesterday I was in Walmart with no face mask and a senior citizen  ran scared from me.  I told him if he is that weak he should quarantine himself and not expect society to accommodate his weakness 
Quarantine of the strong and productive is tyranny.  Quarantine of the weak is is health policy.  This is  Darwinism at its best.  Yiu liberals pushed Darwin and now you have it
