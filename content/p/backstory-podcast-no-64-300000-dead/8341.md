 lol........Mayor Wilson was elected after the ballot rigging was stopped when our last election was monitored by either the Secretary of State or the Alabama Attorney General (can't remember which but Fairhope voters requested that the election be monitored so that Mayor Kant could not be illegally 'installed' again.   You must be new here to have missed that by a million miles.
