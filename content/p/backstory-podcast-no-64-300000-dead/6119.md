 Upgrade the sewers?  Repair the pipes and electrical grid?   No no.   These projects aren’t fun and won’t make money for these guys
Go ahead and build subdivisions and more projects that will further tax the infrastructure then let the taxpayers pick up the tab when the town is overbuilt and crowded.  These guys will then leave town looking for another area to ruin.   Like rats these guys bring pestilence.  This is what the Catalysts do as they finance politicians who let them do what they do
