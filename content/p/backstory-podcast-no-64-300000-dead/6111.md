 People should be up in arms about this. A single person has been all but self-designated to make a decision that involves a large cost to the City and pertains to a piece of the City's history located in the heart of downtown. No input from residents, no entertaining of other offers, no coordination with the administration. To top it off, a specially called meeting is now being rescheduled to noon during a work day to approve this? This is OUR money, not his.  If anyone wants to challenge this man for his City Council seat in the next election, this autocratic and authoritarian act will be about all that a challenger needs to point to. Where are the rest of our City Council members?  The "it needed to be done today or else someone else may make an offer" excuse isn't sufficient. This is a shady deal involving shady individuals and unfortunately, not a single one of us will be able to stop it. Remember this during the next election cycle.
