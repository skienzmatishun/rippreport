 I agree.  However, I don't agree that this dilapidated and toxic building should be 'remodeled' as so many are stating;  It needs to be razed. The question is: what replacement would be of most benefit to Fairhope taxpayers (remember us, Jack?). I think that the boutique hotel, financed by a developer and partnered with the City, would be a huge boost to the City's coffers.  Compare that to the City purchasing the Triangle property and other ventures undertaken by Jack Burrell (losers all) and financed by Fairhope taxpayers.  We want and need a vibrant downtown; a boutique hotel would be booked even more than the Marriott.  Wedding receptions every weekend at the Fairhope Inn and at the Venue etc and no other great place to stay downtown other than Hampton (Hampton stays booked 24/365); it would bring walk around business to all of the local restaurants and shops.  I don't see what bonus we receive if the City purchases it for 'future' development.  Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.   Our council needs to FIX THE SEWER SYSTEM AND UPGRADE/REPAIR THE ELECTRICAL GRID;  they need to do their jobs and do what is best for the City.  They are a bunch of stupid cowards if they follow Burrell off of this cliff.
By the way, did you see that a judge shut down the Fly Creek apartments (Jack's baby) because the City Council screwed up and didn't follow its own laws?
