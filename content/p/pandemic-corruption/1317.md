 I have to admit that I totally agree with you about does Diana Brewer has to do with this. Since she was born she has  proven to never be a real winner. She had lost more money and made many poor decisions that I can think of personally. Leave her out if it. She couldn't run a fruit stand much less she has screwed up everything she has touched. Maybe somewhat popular at one time. But I have personally contributed a huge amount of money and time like we all have (another example of screwing up and being awarded for it) The Good ole Alabama ways and what does she care regarding efforts towards conservation. Another screw up by the people!!!!!! who hired her for a position that she is not qualified for what so ever. This will hurt!!!! But it was one of the worse decisions made to put her in that position. Wake up people. You email us almost every day about helping and we have. But be careful in the future. And you other politicians. Take notice. Even the high schoolers are smart enough for that. They care about conservation. But! Don't y'all start thinking Baldwin County people are dumb!!!  That dog is getting tired of hunting. Save your hard work or people  will leave. They already have. Some organization please start respecting and not doing your contributioners wrong. It's dishonest!!!!! And some board members already agree.  What mess did she created in Mobile?
