 Imagine...A Fairhope with a bay so polluted we cannot fish, swim or recreate there. Goodbye Jubilees. A Fairhope where the politicians steal with impunity. A Fairhope where the council of five treats the mayor like a rabid dog. A Fairhope where the traffic is nearing unbearable. A Fairhope where the schools are overcrowded. A Fairhope where the judges are corrupt.  A Fairhope where there is no longer any fair hope for success.

This is Fairhope.

Now.
