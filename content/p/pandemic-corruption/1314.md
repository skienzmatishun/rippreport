 YES, WE DO, 

Those around here have zero idea what is about to happen here in the great state of Alabama. With the expansion of the Panama Canal, the city of Mobile is going to become a major hub for distribution because it is the closest deep water port from the canal.

This area is about to explode with people looking for a job, and they will be good paying jobs. Crime is still too high in Mobile, but even Mobile will grow in housing. 

The logical choice will be Baldwin County, so everyone needs to get ready for this. No one is going to be able to stop it, it is best to embrace it, prepare for it and start now.

So many people are moving from the north to the South, look at Atlanta and area. Once that bridge gets built from Mobile to Baldwin County, the county will expand biggly.

The great migration has begun sports fans because our county will double in the next 20 years.
