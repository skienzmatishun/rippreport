 UNQUALIFIED EMPLOYEES - this has to the greatest fake post yet!

The mayor hired some lady to be economic development director that has not had a collegiate economic class in her life. Non-college educated, never held a position as an economic development of anything and is making more money than everyone within the city!

She will get to list this position on her resume, she will move on because she has NEVER held a position more than 3 years, and she will leverage this experience to make even more money.

She will get to do this all because she is a friend of the mayor and the mayor's advisor! 

This reminds me of a Clinton excuses, it is everyone's fault except Clinton. The mayor and her 'supporters' like to point fingers now, those fingers are getting pointed back because of the mayor's actions! And the mayors 'supporters' are hating it.

Unqualified, the mayor, and her sidekick is the ones unqualified. You, the mayor and her little sidekick don't know Jack!
