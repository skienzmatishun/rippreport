 That is why you elect a mayor that is "supposed" to be the leader! You elect their vision and their vision is not what the majority wants or you do not elect them! 

Plain and simple! 

You elect a council to ensure the mayor does not break the cities budget! It is a check and balance, the worse the mayor the tougher the council, the better the mayor the easier the council is to work with.

Therefore, we have a mayor that wants to change everything yesterday, and the council is on board but not at the pace the mayor wants. They are realist and wise!
