 Again, deflecting blame on the blacks. You must not be in the party of personal responsibility.  You must not be a conservative since you want to bankrupt our country to support a paper army.  One that dissolved in a week.  Trillions.  And you want more. Its safe to say that you were likely one of the people calling those who thought the war was a big waste of money a bunch of pussies.  Because they had common sense.  We could have saved trillions and trillions for the same result.
