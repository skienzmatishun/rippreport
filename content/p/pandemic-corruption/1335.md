 Everyone who owns land here thinks its okay to build a subdivision. You rednecks are insane! 

I think soon people will start moving from Fairhope once the traffic and other problems get so bad they hate the place.

Not to mention the corruption. Nice $45k without an invoice, council.

Dipshits somebody said--that's the council five.
