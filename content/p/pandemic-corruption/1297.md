 Here is what I find interesting - the citizens of Fly Creek can sue the city and this is okay, Ripp loves it. Then when the mayor get sued for harassing the HR director, Ripp finds all of this to be bad.  

There should be just as much outrage about what the mayor did as the Fly Creek deal. 

Hell no, you all defend this mayor no matter what she does. You say things like "well Kant did it" and that is the dumbest defense ever. Just because you were abused as a child does not mean you abuse your children. 

Hopefully, you can learn from the past, this mayor is an embarrassment for all of us. Can not wait until she gets deposed, speaking of fly, I would love to be a fly on the wall and listen to her stutter and say well, huh, uh, duh, duh, well, you see, oh my, oh me...settle-dee.

Oh boy, I wonder how much of the wine profits in her bar, she has drunk since being served? She was right, it was not an assault, it was harassment and it is still against the law!

Saddle-up folks!
