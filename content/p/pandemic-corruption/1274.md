 Fact! Estimate!  Don't join the dumbass crowd who think they know it all. It is indeed ALL JUST estimates.  It will ALWAYS BE JUST AN ESTIMATE! Who gives a crap if it's 50 or 50,000. We all need to work together to make adjustments for what ever amounts of the increasing population is or will be. Don't let someone who thinks they know exact numbers tell you that you are dealing with 7 year old figures and make you think anything different. They are living more in the past than you are. Geeze. When someone wants  to be a jerk. Let them be a jerk. They like to think they are so right. So let them. Everyone knows who they are. Stay out of the jerkoff crowd. Now that's a hard task to do in the present. And that is not an estimated guess!
