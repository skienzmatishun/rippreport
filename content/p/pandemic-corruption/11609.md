 If you end up sick with covid or are injured and the hospital is at or near capacity, please don't be a hypocrite. Do not under any circumstance go to the hospital if thats the case. Please go back to your doctor for help.  I don't want to have to pay for the bills that you cannot with my taxes. My taxes should not go out to save the medical system from collapse due to people like you.
