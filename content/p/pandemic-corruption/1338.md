 Not true.  Jimmy went out of his way to not make any negative comments about Brewer.  He is a real gentleman and refused to sling mud.  This was very important to him during the campaign.  Also, Brewer did not "almost win."  He beat her 66.04% to 33.96% in a clean race.  So be careful about accusing people of spreading false propaganda.
