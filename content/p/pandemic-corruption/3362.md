 Dr Tankersley is no doubt my kind of physician...his moral compass and ethics are exactly where they should be. I search very hard to find a physician that doesnt buy into all of the federal oversight of my healthcare. I use Liberty Healthshare for many reasons, one being, eliminating unecessary interference from the faceless androids that have no business knowing one thing about me. If anyone believes that a practicing physician is unethical because he puts his patients and his own privacy ahead of the megacorptocracy we call medicine today, has much to learn. If any alive and awake person believes more state interference makes one more ethical is doomed to repeat this cycle of enslavement to beauracracy...one razor slice at a time.
