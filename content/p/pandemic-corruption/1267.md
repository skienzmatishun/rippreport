 Unfortunately you are giving false information regarding population statics in your comments.  The Office of Management and Budget used by federal statistical agencies update the statistical demographic information annually.  The US Census Bureau uses the Population Estimates Program which updates annually.    The zip code for Fairhope (36532)  is determined by USPS and includes area which are not incorporated within the city limits of Fairhope.    The city limits of Fairhope using 2016 estimates is 16,857 and the zip code boundary has a 2016 population estimate of 32,079. We are not guessing when we say the population of the area serviced by the City of Fairhope is over 20,000 people.
