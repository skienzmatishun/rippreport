 So you are saying he is as bad as them? I would agree, if your statement is true. The Ethics Commission has aided and abetted corruption by allowing the powerful or elected to skirt the law by using Ethics Commission Opinions to circumvent the law, while constituents may have to answer to ethics charges. It is totally corrupt and no one takes them seriously. They refused to even look into the Sen. Pittman BP case and then good ole big Luther turned a blind eye.
