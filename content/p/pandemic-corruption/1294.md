 Let this dipshit help you our here - it is called the Fairhope Police Jurisdiction which extends out 3-miles from the city limits. The Fairhope planning jurisdiction is set by the city leaders and purportedly extends out to Fish River! 

What is the number of citizens within the city limits?

Now, most within the planning jurisdiction are paying 1% property tax to the city.

One of the reasons it takes longer to get to I-10 is 181 needs to be wider and this has been approved. Now, dumbass, you don't build a 5 lane road when it is not needed, then when the traffic count is there, they widen the roads.

Many that drive on 181 do not obey the speed laws, some drive 10 - 15 MPH faster, and it is the ones that drive 5-10 MPH under that causes the delays, if people would drive the speed limit or 2-5 MPH faster, the traffic would be less.

It is the redneck politicians that built the city, not you! Move to Mobile!
