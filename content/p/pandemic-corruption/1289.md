 Hey dipshits...there are easily over 20k living in "Fairhope" which includes Wal-Mart and surrounding areas like Barnwell, etc. All of these people use the roads you rocket scientists! 

It took me 23 minutes get to I ten yesterday at 230 p.m. 

Try it at five guys. 

Daphne is building as much as it can. This hurts our commute times. No regionalism in Baldwin...where apes like Jack Burrell and silver backs like Boone run the show.

It's a cro magnon existence. 

Wake up and get rid of these backward, redneck politicians!!
