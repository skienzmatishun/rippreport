 People who post negative comments on this blog are the people who stand to lose a great deal if the mayor is successful. Why do they read and post here? Because Ripp stands for one thing - exposing corruption. He's an activist. He isn't gaining anything politically or monitarily. And he's not anonymous!!  

It is the COUNCIL that has zero plan or vision. All they do is talk smack about the mayor to deflect the fact they do absolutely nothing. I mean N.O.T.H.I.N.G. If council continues to busy themselves just trying to make her look bad I guess they think we won't notice they're idiots?

Jack is a hot-head, fake bully who thrives on power. Robert is a DEVELOPER and following in Jack's footsteps.  Jay is a joke - just take the rest of the term off. Kevin...a total embarrassment and crook. Jimmy- I can't figure him out-riding the middle.  They all need to go or start working with the mayor. 

And why in the world would anyone interview Diana Brewer or Joe McNerney?  Both have added no value to our city. Just jumping on the bandwagon.
