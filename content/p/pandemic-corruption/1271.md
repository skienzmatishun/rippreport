 You mean it has a margin of error, as in a confidence interval? Just like the polls in the election when Trump did not have a chance to win, the election was over...

Did you pass elementary statistics? It appears not.

So, what you are also saying is every time an estimate is used for a census, the house of representatives should change based upon this estimate? 

Please, you are showing just how stupid you are, these are not official numbers. They are a SWAG, a sophisticated wild ass guess!

You must work for the new mayor! 

"plus or minus differentiation" jezzz!
