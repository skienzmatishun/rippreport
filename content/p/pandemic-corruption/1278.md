 Who cares about 50, or 50,000? Wake up, are you that stupid? Wait and see what the numbers end up being in the end, and you'll look back and see. There will be an estimate of 123, and it will be off by 3% and that is a lot. 3% of 50 is not much, 3% of 50,000 is more meaningful.

This is why the commerce department does revised numbers! They "estimate" in the beginning, then the data is fully analyzed and the number are restated with a margin of error and sometimes they are really off base!

I am tired of the jerkoff crowd misstating facts on here and you are one of them. That is why crap get stirred up, individuals don't know Jack! If they want to blog then state that the Fairhope population is "estimated" at 123, not state it as a fact 

I bet Hillary Clinton wished there was a better "estimate" in the polls! She would have traveled to Michigan, Wisconsin to ensure the win, but no, they had estimated the numbers!

Learn how to speak the language, if you can't then go back to the bookstore and read fairy tell stories! This like someone stating the mayor "assaulted" instead of "harassed" the HR lady.  

You sound like a community ecomomic development person that is high school educated!
