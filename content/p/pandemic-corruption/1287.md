 Fairhope high is building a new wing...it ain't even enough...they are keeping the trailers. fairhope acts all high fallutin but when the rubber hits the road it is a fast-growing redneck town with inadequate infrastructure and a corrupt government. Karin Wilson is the city's only hope. Jack and his band of development  fiends will ruin it. The airport thing is a joke. They are caught. Most Fairhopians don't know we pay the airport authority 400k per month. 

This could go to help schools. I am upset with this council. It looks clearly to me that all five are part of the GOB. Sad but true. Ignorance is obviously bliss in Fairhope. One day we will all hang our heads when Fairhope is another Robertsdale.
