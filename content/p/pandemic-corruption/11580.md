 I truly hope some of these comments are meant as satire or really bad jokes, knowing 60% of Alabama citizens are un-vaccinated. Fairhope restaurants and business are closed. People know people that have died of Covid. Fairhope municipality has as much as 10% of it's employees out with Covid. Thomas Hospital is full patients with covid. Teachers are scared to death, yet we still can not convince un-vaccinated of the dangers. If you are un-vaccinated and get covid have to go to the hospital,and be put on a ventilator, the last thing you may see is nurses and doctors trying to save your life. They ALL WILL BE WEARING MASKS&gt;
