 Fairhope school is under the county board of education, not the city council. Wilson can not help much with the school either.

The mayor nor the council can do a lot, especially since the mayor is spending the city's money with high salaries for her friends and NOW spending money to defend these lawsuits! So, if we are going to say the money used for the airport then lets use talk about other monies spent.

That airport is an issue, and but what can be done now? The city takes back the land, now what? You have the damn answers, tell us, the city takes by the land, then the city now has all the liability of owning an airport. What I love about people like you is you manage by hind-site, that is easy, anyone can manage my looking back, it is those that have to manage now that makes management hard.

The folks of Robertsdale might be laughing at that remark, you can new judge a book by its cover, if you did then you would have to agree that the mayor would be a book no one would want to read!

IF this mayor is our only hope, then it is over, we all need to pack it up and move somewhere else. Hell, even her "bested" friend Ripp has stated, "...mayor made a bad mistake when she took office..." So take it from the expert, Ripp himself!
