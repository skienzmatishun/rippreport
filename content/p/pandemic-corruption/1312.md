 Sherry Lea don't let them bring you down 
This is "their" style.... "They" will bully you, harass you, sue you, make up false stories.  Whatever disgusting techniques to wear you down they will do it!!!
Don't let them win!! They want the mayor to have no support on the inside. Next they will go after Lynn Maser and on and on.  We've got them !! It's obvious... They're trying anything and everything to divert attention away from the corruption that has been taking place in this town. 
Alabama secretary of the state, John Merrill heard the citizens of Fairhope when they wanted someone to oversee the election. He's a good man.  He has his eye on Fairhope...
