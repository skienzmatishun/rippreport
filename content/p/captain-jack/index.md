Fairhope Airport Authority recently held a special meeting, Jan 8th to discuss a “notice of availability”.

The notice covers many issues and the final draft, particularly the issue of leases, bidding procedures and fuel farms, are all issues being revisited from the “failed” process in late 2016. This was the subject of a series of Ripp Report articles covering the infamous lease in question at the time. The first article was posted Nov. 2016.

Have no fear Fairhope, the people involved with, You Don’t Know Jack, are now going to set the rules for everyone else. Council President Burrell, the City liaison on the board, showed up late, without pen, paper or notes, which he had to borrow, but he let Airport Authority Chairman Joe McEnerney know who was Captain.

Captain Jack blasted Joe at about minute 14:00. Seems Joe, who is the Chairman of the Board, was guaranteeing certain "chosen ones" hanger locations, prior to any bid process. Joe even gave the Ripp Report a shout out at the end of the meeting.

Captain Jack has made it perfectly clear from his past actions that no one gets a hanger location without Captain Jack’s approval. He should not hold the title of city liaison, he has not represented the citizens or the best interests of the community.

As President of the Council, he has run the Airport Authority to the satisfaction of the 1%, or less, that use the Airport. Captain Jack was also the man who made sure the City Attorney and Municipal Judge appointments went as he wished. Hopefully all three will leave their posts in the next election.

Captain Jack has dominated the position of Council President, going on 7 years. The Council has learned what Joe has not, that is, Captain Jack is flying the plane, they are only passengers.

Captain Jack needs to be demoted to private.
