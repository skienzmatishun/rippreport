Baldwin County has only one example of a state elected official, who received, and took action, on multiple complaints from the general public, related to possible election tampering. ONLY ONE, think about that!

Complaints have been filed in Baldwin County with the Alabama Judiciary about certain Judges, Michelle Thomason and Buddy Bracken, in particular. The Judiciary did nothing and the complaints continue.

Complaints have been filed with the Alabama Bar Association about numerous attorneys, Steven Johnson topping the list, nothing was done.

Numerous complaints have been filed with the Alabama Ethics Commission involving multiple elected officials in Baldwin County. Not one single case found any probable cause of ethics violations. Sen. Trip Pittman was given a pass and allowed to keep his $750,000 from BP. In any other state he would have been given prison time.

Let’s not leave out the Attorney General of Alabama who is aware of the problems voters have about exposing corruption, yet nothing changes.

Governor Kay Ivey just signed HB 371:

Alabama is going backwards.

Last but certainly not least is the Baldwin County District Attorney’s office. They will listen to complaints however they will never act upon them. It is a total waste of time to expect the DA’s office to investigate or charge ANY elected official in Baldwin County.

The Alabama Sec. Of State is the only elected state official that has received complaints from constituents of Baldwin County, Fairhope, and acted on those complaints. Fairhope’s elections in the past had been very suspicious, and many residents believed that the city election process had been compromised. No direct evidence was available of wrong doing, however the end result of the last two elections raised many red flags.

The Ripp Report had submitted complaints to the Alabama Sec, of State for the past two elections. This paper trail added to the credibility of the complaints filed in 2016. As a result of the Ripp Reports, numerous individuals, not known to me, also complained and voiced their concerns.

John Merrill, Sec. of State took the unprecedented move to have the 2016 Fairhope election monitored by his office. Karin Wilson, facing an Incumbent Mayor of 16 years with four times as much campaign money, won by approximately 600 votes. Many citizens of Fairhope believe this outcome was only possible due to the polling places being monitored by the Sec. Of State.

John Merrill Sec. Of State for Alabama will be getting my vote I encourage you to do the same.

IF YOU HAVE ANY SUSPICIONS ABOUT THE UPCOMING PRIMARIES OR ELECTION, IN BALDWIN COUNTY, PLEASE CONTACT THE SEC. OF STATE AND NOTIFY THE RIPP REPORT.
