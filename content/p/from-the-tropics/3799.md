 I already heard from Richard Shelby's camp that he's switching back to Democrat. Let's not forget too quickly that he was a democrat and after winning as a democrat, he switched parties and became a republican. Now that Doug Jones, the Democrat who just won the Alabama US senate seat. Shelby is from what I understand is going to switch AGAIN and switch back to being a democrat. This should be illegal and it it a damn shame that we have let a liberal in disguise, Richard Shelby, cost us a republican seat in the US senate. Thanks Richard. You don't deserve to be called a senator from Alabama anymore than a monkey f ing a football.
