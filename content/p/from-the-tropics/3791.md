 David Boyett describes himself as a republican and alignes himself with John (sorry liberal) McCain. Says 70% of Alabamaians dislike Roy Moore. What have you David Boyett or John McCain ever done for this Country. I know McCain's flying buddie. If McCain wasn't such a drunk. He might not have gotten shot down. Damn sure hasn't done anything for us as a politician.
