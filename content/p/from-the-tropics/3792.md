 Don't be so quick to judge all thee media members who try to tell the black folks they better get out and vote for Doug Jones. Black, yellow, red or white. Let people judge for themselves because God will judge all of us in the end. How dare some you politicians and media members pretend to be God himself and cast judgement on whom ever you should decide on for the moment. May God strike you down with GREAT VENGEANCE should you be judging without facts and judging not yourselves and your own families.
