summary: The Ripp Report has been missing in action for about two months. I had my 14th shoulder operation on Nov.4th and that took me out for about 4 weeks. That operation has been very successful. Then quite unexpected I got vertigo which has taken me about 4 weeks to kick to the curb. At the same time Meta locked me out of my social media pages, The Ripp Report, BCLE and F. Paul Ripp.

The Ripp Report has been missing in action for about two months. I had my 14th shoulder operation on Nov.4th and that took me out for about 4 weeks. That operation has been very successful. Then quite unexpected I got vertigo which has taken me about 4 weeks to kick to the curb. At the same time Meta locked me out of my social media pages, The Ripp Report, Baldwin County Legal Eagle and F. Paul Ripp. This problem has affected thousands and locked out administrators on pages throughout the country.

So for right now we will be using our .com site, <a href="https://rippreport.com/">rippreport.com</a> as our major site.

Even though we have been M.I.A we have stayed up with the absolutely crazy politics of Alabama and especially Baldwin County. Were Back Stay Tuned.
