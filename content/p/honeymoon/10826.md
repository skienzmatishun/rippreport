 There needs to be an election because there's more than a year left in the term. Jay would likely be a shoo-in because voters don't know he's part of the establishment.  Regardless, trying to get away without an election is routine behavior for this lot. 

We need someone who is not part of the establishment. It only takes one person who is NOT a part of CSB to communicate the truth.  Everyone was asleep at the wheel during the last election and let the one person who worked for citizens go -  Mayor Wilson. Now we will never have transparent communication again.
