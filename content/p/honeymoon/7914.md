 So, when Karin was running for Mayor She said our utility  bills were too high &amp; she would do something about them.  Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, for 3 straight months in a row my bill has been over $650.00 &amp; the one due in October is right at $700.00.  I have lived In the SAME home for 26 years  &amp; Maybe once a year it comes close to $600.00.  What the S_ it is going on??!!??  This is more than ridiculous &amp; needs to be investigated.  She is MORE than full of it!!!  Bigger cities do not charge even close to this much!!!
