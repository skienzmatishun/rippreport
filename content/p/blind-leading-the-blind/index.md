 In Fairhope Transparency is being promoted by a Jester. His followers do not care about facts only the Jester spin. The Jester, Boone and Burrell are now calling for community engagement in reference to the Greeno Road Overlay District. Citizens agree and the Mayor has already implemented several public meetings, so what the hell are they talking about? DISTRACTION. The same three hypocrites had NO Community Engagement when they voted themselves full family insurance. They had NO community engagement for the 2.6 million dollar recreation land and they unanimously said NO to the black community when it came to recreation land. Remember that in 2020.

The Jester, Burrell and Boone do not know what Transparency, Accountability, Ethics or what constitutes a Conflict of interest. I promised that I would follow through on a complaint against Councilman Robert Brown this week.

Councilman Brown and his business partner Cliff Pitman are making a mockery of Ethical Conduct. Sure some of the sneaky self serving things they are doing may not be criminal but the lack of Ethics stains Fairhope and the Citizens of the Community.

The Citizens of Fairhope have to stand up to the Jester and his demented view of right and wrong. Three of the Council, Burrell Boone and especially Brown, have used their elected position for personal gain. I will repeat, it may not be criminal, in some instances, but it defies all standards of honest Government

This last Monday, September 16, 2019 I personally delivered a complaint against Councilman Robert Brown to the Alabama Attorney General, White Collar Crime Division, Special Prosecutors. The complaint letter was accompanied by a 42 page booklet of supporting, and related, documents.

What will the Attorney General do? I do not know, however you as citizens should have enough common sense to see through the Jester’s Bull Sh-- interpretation of “transparency”.
