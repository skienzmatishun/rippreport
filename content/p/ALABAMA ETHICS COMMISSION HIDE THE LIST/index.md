If you are caught stealing 10 dollars from Wal-Mart, YOU are going to jail. If you steal 3.2 Million and distribute those funds to Judges, Bankers, Lawyers and Politicians by using a trust, that you are a trustee of, KNOW, you could get away with it, in Alabama. Especially if you happen to be the Executive Director of the Ethics Commission, Mr. Tom Albritton.


**Google Lagniappe, Mabel Amos Trust, Tom Albritton,The Ripp Report.com**


[Search Tom Albritton](https://www.google.com/search?q=lagniappe+tom+albritton)

Who is on the LIST? Who took scholarship money for “their” privileged kids and denied the kids that deserved and qualified, for the scholarships?

[Lawrence v. State](https://law.justia.com/cases/alabama/court-of-appeals-criminal/2006/cr-04-1864-0.html)

>“Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall’s office became involved in the civil litigation in its oversight capacity over charitable trusts, and told Griffin during a November hearing that a deal between the AG and Regions had been reached that would make the trust whole.
>Plaintiffs against the fund and Regions have demanded the names of those who received more than $3.2 million in scholarships between 2013 and 2021 be made public”

This may be one of Alabama’s most rotten examples of our history of deep rooted political corruption in the last 30 years. The List should be made public of all the names of those “selected” by the trustees of the Mabel Amos Trust. Mr Albritton is a disgrace and the fact that he is the Executive Director of Alabama Ethics Commission is a slap in the face of all Alabamians. The Alabama Bar originally signed off on Mr. Albritton actions, they want the list to be sealed as well, wonder why?

At the same time Mr. Albritton was a trustee and the Ethics Director he routinely denied legitimate Ethics complaints filed by citizens of Alabama. If Mr. Albritton will do what he did as a trustee, then it is a very good chance that he could be convinced to overlook any Ethics complaints against the same kind of “Good ole Boys” that got trustee money.

Two things need to Happen:
1. The Mabel Amos list needs to be made public
2. The Attorney General needs to investigate all Ethics complaints Mr. Albritton as Ethics Director dismissed while he was trustee of the Mabel Amos Trust.

With the exception of Lagniappe paper in Mobile, most so called Alabama news organizations have tipped toed around the story. Why is the media not raising hell that the LIST be made public. Why has Governor Kay Ivy been silent on THE LIST.


Why are the POLITICIANS so quiet?


What can you do ? Write or call your state representative, Legislative delegation, Governor Ivy or CALL:

ATTORNEY GENERAL COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR : AMANDA PRIEST


334-322-5694 OR CAMERON MIXON 334-322-5694


WE THE CITIZENS WANT TO SEE THE LIST OF PRIVILEGED POLITICIANS, LAWYERS, BANKERS, JUDGES AND FRIENDS OF ETHICS DIRECTOR TOM ALBRITTON. WHO RECEIVED 3.2 MILLION FROM A SCHOLARSHIP TRUST.


REMEMBER DO NOT STEAL FROM WAL-MART YOU WILL GO TO JAIL.
