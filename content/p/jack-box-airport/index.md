The Airport Authority has a great idea! They are going to use your tax dollars to hire “ the top ethics attorney in Alabama” to investigate me and The Ripp Report, and attempt to “head off” any investigation with the Attorney General’s office and the Ethics Commission. Your tax dollars are going to pay for the defense of the authority board members, Jack Burrell and Ray Hix, who are the focus of the complaint. Mr. Burrell is an elected official as well as a board member making him far more responsible for his actions. This will be an end run around the investigation and an attempt through judicial means to quash accountability by using attorneys to talk with attorneys who will confer with more attorneys, they are all getting paid, and come up with a very clever explanation, written by another attorney.

Right now you should be thinking WTF, but wait there is more. The “top ethics attorney of Alabama is Ray Hix’s Attorney who prepared the lease in question and was paid by Mr. Hix to prepare a request of the Ethics Commission for an Advisory Opinion. The Ripp Report is still requesting a copy of that letter for our “investigation”. The Authority is hiring Mr. Hix attorney to represent the authority while Mr. Hix holds the position of Sec. Treasurer for the Authority, to investigate a legitimate complaint already in the hands of authorities.

Now your head should be really spinning but just keep turning that crank because here comes Jack in the box. A Fairhope resident who inquired with the Ethics Commission Chief Council, Mr. Hugh Evens, sought information relative to the Fairhope Airport Authority. At the time I had no knowledge of the request and the Fairhope resident had every expectation of confidentially. Mr. Evens blind copied Mr. Bailey, Mr. Hix's attorney. Hey Hey Jack in the box, attorney talking with attorney who is. to be paid by an attorney. Ethics what the hell is that? It is not in the box with Jack.

Keep turning that crank because here comes Jack. While all the above is going on and many more questions, than answers about the Airport Authority, Mr. Burrell is deflecting his responsibility and saying it’s the Mayor’s fault. B.S. what the Mayor did was inherent a nightmare by being elected, if Mayor Kant was still around you would have never heard a word. It was the Mayor who refused to take two salaries from the city, that cost Mayor Wilson 90,000 dollars, that my friends is what you call ETHICS.

The local print media has been given a copy of the complaint as it was submitted. Why are they not all over this story? Can they not find Jack in the box? Maybe that is him we hear flying?

Someone please put Jack back in the box. Before it's too late.
