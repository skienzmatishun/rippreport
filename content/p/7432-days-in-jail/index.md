There is every reason to believe that they conspired to withhold vital information from the defense that resulted in an innocent man spending 7432 days, so far, in jail.

“Suppression of evidence favorable to the accused by the prosecution violates constitutional due process, where the evidence is material, either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.”
