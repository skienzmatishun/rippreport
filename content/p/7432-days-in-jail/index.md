That’s how long Murray Bubba Lawrence has been in jail for a crime he did not commit. Baldwin County Sheriff Hoss Mack, the Prosecutor, David Whetstone and the Judge, currently the District Attorney, Robert Wilters are responsible. There is every reason to believe that they conspired to withhold vital information from the defense that resulted in an innocent man spending 7432 days, so far, in jail.

Brady vs. Maryland---The 1963 United States Supreme Court ruling that:


>Suppression of evidence favorable to the accused by the prosecution violates constitutional due process, where the evidence is material, either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.


What should be the sentence of the Sheriff, Prosecutor and Judge, if indeed, they are found guilty of false prosecution of a man that spent:

7432 days

IN JAIL


WHO WAS INNOCENT AND THEY KNEW IT!
