These are two articles that were covered by [The Fairhope Times](https://cdn.rippreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/thefairhopetimes.blogspot.com) one year ago. These were not written by the Ripp Report. They are important because they show, prior to today’s airport controversy, there was every indication that something stunk at the airport.

{{< socialpreview url="https://thefairhopetimes.blogspot.com/2015/10/airport-authoirity-holds-illegal-meeting.html" >}}

This should have been a warning sign. However, the major players at the airport had the Mayor and City Council, at that time, covering their back. Well, that Mayor and more that half the City Council are gone. Now the stink from those deeds a year ago is coming back, this time to the nostrils of the public.

Don’t worry folks you will get the whole story, very soon.

The next month after the illegal meeting, Fairhope City Council got additional training in Alabama Ethics.  I am sorry to report that they failed the course.

Today, {{< socialpreview url="https://rippreport.com/p/you-dont-know-jack/" >}}

and the accompanying article,

{{< socialpreview url="https://rippreport.com/p/fairhope-airport-un_authorized/" >}}

are the results of the previous bad behavior that became much worse. You will get the condensed narrative as soon as we have all the documents, after New Years. No sense in ruining our Christmas and New Year with another story of inside trading and political corruption.

HAVE A WONDERFUL WEDNESDAY
