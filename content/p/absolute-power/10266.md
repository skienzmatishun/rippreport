 Hey Georgia Orwell.....take a break and shut the F%*K up for a moment.  You think the Mayor Wilson and her husband had a chip on their shoulder?   They are great people and have done so much for Fairhope. Shut the F! Up loser. Good luck Sherry, many of us who put her in office know that she will do right by us and not let the 3 bbbâ€™s run the whole show. Again, Georgia, go start your own blog, write a book but at least start contributing to making Fairhope a better city. Talk is cheap and you are full of crap!
