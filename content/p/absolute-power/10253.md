 Rock Creaker,
What are the folks in Rock Creek going to do when the over-building decreases the values of the homes you all overpaid in that oversized subdivision?  I mean Rock Creek go through Rock Creek and you will see big houses on small lots.  Now with apartments coming in and the "patio home" phase, it looks like Rock Creek is filling up.  The patio homes are really just cheaper houses built beside the bigger houses to extract values from the earlier-built houses at the cost of the existing larger homes.
These real estate developers are smart.  They can work the local governments and their past customers to make a buck.
Well, actually they don't need to "work" the council in this town because the council members are either in the business themselves or are funded by the developers.
Then with a free ride to do what they want to do, these real estate developers build whatever they want in wherever place they want without any checks or balances.
The local people suffer with paying more taxes, end up with traffic jams, more crime, have the local natural amenities be restricted, and become second class citizens in their own hometown.
This is what "PREDATORY DEVELOPERS" do.
Right now, our local government work for these predators.  Because the mass voters are too busy working, they donot see what is going on.  I guess the voters have only themselves to blame.
