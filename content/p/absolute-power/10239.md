 I supported Mayor Wilson and believe that she has worked her butt off to fix decades of neglect by Mayor Kant.  However, she could never have won a second term; she and her husband are not very friendly people.  I love Page &amp; Pallette &amp; I adore their sweet daughters, but Karin &amp; her husband  both have such chips on their shoulders that they shunned those of us who tried to be supportive.  Burrell treated her horribly but that was no reason to shun everyone else in town.  However, I am grateful every day that she defeated the previous mayor, Mr. Kant.  If Karin Wilson had not won 4 years ago, there may not even be a sewer system!  And, don't forget, Wilson made no money......she hired a professional engineer to run the Utilities division  while she made a mere pittance to be CEO of the City.  I think that Mayor Wilson earned $30,000 per year and declined the $90,000 that Mayor Kant took as the Director of Utilities (what engineering background did he have).  Sherry Sullivan will earn $90,000 as Mayor and has not declared whether she will be the Director of Utilities making that other $90,000.  That's a lot of money for someone that may not be an engineer.  My figures may be off......can't recall if it's 60 or 90; either way, if Sullivan takes an extra salary as Director of Utilities (or brings in Kant), we will know that she is not for Fairhope.
