 I hope that Sullivan's campaign promises were true and that she will not be complicit in the further raping of Fairhope by politicians and developer (and crooked lawyers.....she should get rid of that horrid city attorney first thing; otherwise she will be judged by his ignorance/laziness/corruption.  Not many people voted because most people don't care, but Sullivan could be great if she is not 'rubber stamp' to Tim Kant, Corte and the Coin operated council.  I don't know if she has kids, but she should know that every move she makes will come back to bite them.  I wish her courage and luck and beg her to please not give away the Triangle property to a trust that will ultimately give it to developers!
