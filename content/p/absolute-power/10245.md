 Ought to be interesting. I saw lots of familiar faces in the campaign photos. Fidler, McCrory, Heathcoe, Kants wife to name a few. We’ll see if the IT director, the building maintenance supervisor, the community development and public affairs director, and the utilities director survive the transition to the new mayor. She emphasized having the right employees in place. Maybe I’m reading too much into that.
