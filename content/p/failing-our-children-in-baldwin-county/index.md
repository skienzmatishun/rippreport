To all who have an interest in the safety of children in Baldwin County, Alabama and beyond,

I am writing to express my deep concern as a father and long-time resident of Baldwin County, Alabama, regarding a series of systemic failures that have endangered my daughter and left other vulnerable children unprotected. These failures involve law enforcement, the Department of Human Resources (DHR), the family court system, and the court-appointed Guardian Ad Litem (GAL), and I urge you to take immediate action to investigate these matters and hold those responsible accountable.

For over five months, my daughter was repeatedly placed in situations where her safety was compromised. She was exposed to and allowed to participate with inappropriate behavior, including sexual intercourse and the sharing of explicit materials involving explicit images and videos, while under the care and supervision of two mothers. Despite the involvement of multiple agencies, including the Baldwin County Sheriff Department, Daphne Police Department, Loxley Police Department, DHR, and the family court system, no effective action was taken to intervene or protect the children involved.

Detective Trey Kraynak of the Daphne Police Department was assigned to investigate the case (Case #230 700 147). However, despite the severity of the situation, both law enforcement, DHR, and the family court system failed to take the necessary steps to protect these children. DHR conducted an investigation but did not perform home inspections or interviews with the mothers involved, demonstrating a lack of thoroughness and attention to the case. Additionally, the Baldwin County Child Advocacy Center conducted forensic interviews of both children, where both children
admitted to having sexual intercourse, yet no meaningful action was taken afterward. Moreover, I am deeply concerned about the performance of the court-appointed Guardian Ad Litem (GAL) in this case. After meeting with the GAL on May 9, 2024 and paying the required $500 deposit, I received no follow-up communication from him. He failed to conduct a home inspection and, to my knowledge, did not interview my daughter. In court, the GAL behavior was troubling, as he chose to sit with the mother and her attorney, which seemed to show a conflict of interest, undermining his role as a
neutral advocate for my daughters best interests.

Additionally, my own family law case has been mishandled. I was forced to terminate my attorney just one week before trial due to issues with communication, case preparation, and a lack of understanding of the evidence on my attorney’s part. Despite explaining this situation to the judge presiding over my case (CASE #DR-2017-900956.03), my case was dismissed without recourse. While the opposing party was granted a continuance after our previous trial had begun on March 5, 2024, I was denied the same request, leaving me without legal representation and unable to effectively defend my rights or protect my daughter.

During the course of these events, the mother of our daughter was arrested on January 10, 2024, for Domestic Family Violence, and the mother of the boy attempted suicide, both of which were significant indicators of instability and a potential danger to the children. Despite these serious occurrences, no action was taken to protect the two minor children involved. The arrest and suicide attempt should have served as clear red flags, prompting immediate intervention to ensure the safety of the children. Instead, the agencies involved, including law enforcement and DHR,failed to respond appropriately, allowing these vulnerable children to remain in an environment where their safety was continuously at risk. This neglectful lack of action exacerbates the trauma these children endured and highlights the systemic failures in place to protect those who need it most.

There is a clear pattern of systemic failures within the agencies and courts tasked with protecting children in Baldwin County, as demonstrated by the lack of action in this case. Several news reports have shed light on the ongoing issues within DHR, and I urge you to review the following articles with video:


1. Fox10 News DHR Investigation Reveals Staffing Shortfalls

2. Fox10 News DHR Staffing Controversy following-controversy/

{{< socialpreview url="https://www.fox10tv.com/video/2024/07/20/update-baldwin-county-dhr-staffing-following-controversy/" >}}

On a very personal level, my daughter has paid the price for the shortcomings of DHR, and I believe the same can be said for many other children in Baldwin County who continue to be exposed to neglect and abuse due to these systemic failures.

These systemic failures within Baldwin County have not only harmed my daughter but also risk tarnishing the county’s reputation. Baldwin County has long thrived as a family-friendly destination and is known for its strong tourism, real estate, and the business climate. However, when child abuse and neglect go unaddressed, it damages public trust, which is essential for the county's success. As my case and hundreds of other cases becomes known, I fear Baldwin County may face negative attention both locally and nationally. Such publicity could discourage families, tourists, and businesses from coming to Baldwin County, ultimately affecting the economic growth of our community.

The staffing and salary issues within DHR are particularly concerning. With the current staffing shortages and underfunded systems, DHR is unable to adequately respond to cases of child abuse and neglect. This failure to properly address child abuse issues could not only contribute to greater human trafficking risks but also hinder Baldwin County’s ability to attract families and businesses. If Baldwin County is seen as incapable of safeguarding its children, it will likely experience a decline in its reputation, directly impacting tourism and local growth.

I am also concerned about how DHR's shortcomings reflect broader issues with public safety and the community's ability to protect all children, including illegal immigrants and other vulnerable groups, from exploitation.


Given the severity of these issues, I am hoping for a full investigation into how DHR, law enforcement, the GAL, and the family court system failed to act in this case. Specifically, I am asking for an inquiry into why these harmful behaviors were allowed to continue unchecked and why no action was taken to safeguard my daughter and the other child involved.


The mother of my daughter initiated counseling for her at Alta Pointe Health, but despite my 50/50 legal custody and the clear expectation of mutual involvement in decisions regarding her welfare, I was deliberately blocked from obtaining any
information about the counseling or from communicating with the counselor.

This exclusion not only undermines my role as a co-parent but also highlights a larger systemic failure within Baldwin County's child protection system. When one parent is prevented from participating in the decision-making process regarding critical aspects of a child’s care, it demonstrates a breakdown in the system's commitment to transparency and collaboration, both of which are necessary for ensuring that children receive the protection and support they need. This lack of communication and involvement reflects the broader failures of agencies and the court system in protecting children and ensuring both parents have equal opportunities to advocate for their child's well-being.

This situation has had a profound personal impact on me and my family. It has left me feeling powerless to protect my daughter and has violated my rights as a parent. No parent should have to stand by while their child is exposed to such harm, and no child should be left vulnerable to neglect and abuse without intervention.

It is long past due for a change in Alabama! Current research (2023) shows these facts:

According to the Annie E. Casey Foundation’s 2024 Kids Count Data Book, Alabama

ranks 44th among the 50 states in the category of Family &amp; Community.


Furthermore, the America First Policy Institute (AFPI) reports that children with limited or no contact with one of their biological parents account for:


- 63% of youth suicides
- 71% of all substance abusers
- 85% of all youths in prison
- 70% of school dropouts
- Approximately 70% of teenage pregnancies


In instances of divorce or separation:

- 94% of those in Alabama believe "it is in the child's best interest ... to have as much time as possible with each parent"

- 94% of those in Alabama expressed a commitment to vote their beliefs being "more likely to vote for a candidate who supports children spending equal or nearly equal time with each parent ...when both parents are fit and willing to be parents."

Conversely:

- 6% of those in Alabama believe “It is in the child’s best interest to spend as much time as possible with just one parent.”

These are staggering numbers! My judge (an elected public official) literally told me he thinks it’s better for our daughter to spend as much time as possible with just one parent. Well how out of touch is this man?

The result of all this is that my daughter and another child were left neglected and self-supervised in ways that led to their harm.

You can see more details of this research here:

As part of my efforts to seek justice and bring widespread awareness to Alabama and beyond, I am preparing a thorough information package to present to national news outlets such as 48 Hours, 60 Minutes, Dateline, and 20/20. It is critical that the public becomes aware of these failures in our legal and child protection systems, as they have left this case unresolved for more than 15 months. Bringing attention to this issue will help hold those responsible accountable and drive the reform needed to prevent such failures from continuing.

I urge you, if you have the influence, resources and money to take immediate action to investigate this matter thoroughly, hold the responsible parties accountable, and ensure steps are taken to prevent similar situations from occurring in the future, to please do so now! The safety and well-being of

Alabama’s children are too important to ignore, and Baldwin County must be held to the highest standards to ensure our community remains a safe, welcoming, and thriving place for all residents and visitors.

Thank you for your time and attention to this pressing issue. I look forward to your response and any steps you may take to help address these critical matters. I hope this letter brings attention to the systemic failures of MULTIPLE AGENCIES that have left my minor daughter and CHILD in a vulnerable situation.

Sincerely,

Concerned and loving Father
