 Gene, 
The politicians that make up the Catalyst group really do not care about turning  Paradise into a parking lot. They just want to overbuild to make their money.  If this new candidate for mayor is associated with Catalyst then I will not only work to gt Karin re-elected, but I will work to make sure he is defeated.  Let him go back to where he came from and paddleboard there.
