 "They took all the trees
Put them in a tree museum
And they charged all the people
A dollar and a half to see 'em
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got
'Til it's gone
They paved paradise
Put up a parking lot."
- Joni Mitchel

While this song was once considered a "hippie" song, it is ringing true today.
This is what is happening to Baldwin County - all thanks to Catalyst and the puppet politicians they have put in office - including the Fairhope City Council.  They would bulldoze the last tree on earth if it put a dollar in their pockets.  Their greed is despicable.
