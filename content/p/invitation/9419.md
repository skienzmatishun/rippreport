 No, Karin was led over the cliff by the Council.  They set her up
Karin really does care about the people in Fairhope.  She has to do her job while running interference with a spiteful council.  Burrell was mad because he thinks he should be mayor.  Kant was supposed to bless Burrell after Kant retired.  But Kant was forced by Corte to vote for the apartments and Kant lost the election in 2016 to Karin Wilson.  Even Kant wanted to wait until the 2016 election to vote the apartments but Corte became impatient.
Kant's loss messed up Burrell's plans to become Mayor after Kant's planned  retirement in 2020.  \
Now we are looking at 2020 and Burrell is no more closer to becoming mayor than he was in 2016.
The rest of the council will have to face the voters with their antics such as buying property that is overpriced, voting themselves Cadillac health insurance, allowing overbuilding, facing fines for polluting the bay, and allowing overbuilding.
