 This is the only attorney that would take a case like this, fools game. So you go and hire a self-proclaimed alcoholic that was kicked off the city council when he missed over 90 consecutive days, asked forgiveness but was not reinstated, ran for re-election and won, then another DUI and ran for re-election and lost, bigly. Lost his partner in a firm he had, no longer city attorney for any city, he is a solo guy now and thinks he can score quickly in a settlement. Alcohol is expensive you know. You are who you hire - just like everything else that this group tries, this too will fail. Top quality here, I say, this is top quality! 
Trying to make a federal case out of a municipal rule violation. But hey, if this all you have then, go for it. Can't wait for a federal judge to toss this out like all the ethics complaints that get filed by this group!
