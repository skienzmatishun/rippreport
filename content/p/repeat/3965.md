 Time for a wakeup call. Has anyone been paying attention to what happened in Fairhope in 2016? Kant was defeated.

Let that sink in.

Remember that Ripp backed the current council and Mayor against the incumbents and Kant. Recall that Burrell had virtually no opposition. The young girl who ran against him was a placeholder put in there by Kant.

Ripp defeated Kant and now we know that the five councilmen are punks for the machine that tells them all what to do. This machine is made up of either hicks-snedeker or catalyst members. It is a filthy group bent on ruining fairhope as long as they are rich afterwards.

So now Ripp will get Karin relected and he will take out the fairhope council. Now everyone knows who the enemy is. Before it was not so easy to see. Karin, like Trump, has exposed the bad actors.

God Bless Paul Ripp and may the Goobers never sleep lightly.
