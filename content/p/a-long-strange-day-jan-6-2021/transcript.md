On January 6, 2021, a mob of far-right extremists, some linked to white nationalism, stormed the U.S. Capitol just hours after 147 Republican lawmakers voted to overturn the election. Despite certified, fraud-free results confirmed by judges and officials across the aisle, the violence unfolded with minimal police response. Capitol Police, with a $500 million budget, were widely criticized as unprepared; only 14 arrests were made—13 for unlawful entry—by Capitol Police, while DC police reported 26 arrests on Capitol grounds. The mob breached barricades, scaled scaffolding, and breached the Speaker’s office, with one man, Richard Barnett of Arkansas, placing his feet on the podium and stealing an envelope. Protesters carried Confederate flags, deployed Molotov cocktails and chemical irritants, and one was fatally shot. Lawmakers, including Nancy Pelosi and Mike Pence, fled to safety, some barricaded inside the chamber, others grabbing baseball bats for protection. Reporters witnessed chaos as lawmakers rushed to offices, fearing door breaches. Over 80 people were arrested; five firearms—including a military-style assault rifle—were seized, two functioning pipe bombs, and 11 Molotov cocktails, some reportedly ready to detonate. Federal prosecutors recovered a trove of stolen sensitive data, raising national security concerns. Social media threats from groups like the Boogaloo and Proud Boys, flagged by the Anti-Defamation League as early as December 19, highlighted pre-existing dangers. The incident marked a clear breach of democracy, with over half of House Republicans and several senators voting to overturn the election. Vice President Pence formally certified the results: Joe Biden won 306 to Trump’s 232. In the aftermath, critics accused President Trump of inciting the chaos, with Democrats urging Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment due to mental unfitness and incitement of sedition. Former officials including Bill Barr and Jim Mattis condemned Trump’s actions as a betrayal and threat to democracy. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said the events deeply troubled her. Trump remained silent until 4 p.m., when President-elect Biden urgently called on him to defend the Constitution. Later, Trump released a video claiming the election was "stolen," urging supporters to "go home," a message quickly removed from social media. By 6 p.m., a citywide curfew was ordered, and the mob largely dispersed without major reinforcements. At 6 a.m., the mayor declared a curfew; by noon, only 14 arrests were made, despite the scale of the violence. The scene included a noose hung from a makeshift gallows, sparking outrage. Multiple cabinet members resigned. Trump praised supporters on TV, saying “go home, we love you,” while the nation faced a crisis of legitimacy and institutional failure. Congress resumed operations, reaffirming its commitment to democracy, law, and a peaceful transition of power on January 20.
