 Don't you get it, Maw?  These guys aren't Christians.  They say they are Christians because saying they are Christians polls well here in the Bible Belt. 
In reality their true god is the dollar and they worship at the altar of the developers.  Their highest sacrament is approving another subdivision that Belaton, DR Horton, Truland, and Cox wants them to approve. 
These companies are the TRUE Jesus Christ to the County Commission and the municipal councils in Fairhope and Daphne.
So when they say they believe in Jesus, just remember who their "Lord and Savior" truly is.
