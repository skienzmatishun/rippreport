 You cannot be serious, Earner,  Jeb Ball was put in by Catalyst's own Scott Boone.  When asked about his connection to Catalyst, Ball got very defensive saying Boone had "connections" that would put him in office.
Catalyst, formerly known as Elliot, Haygood, and Stacy changed it name to Scott Boone Consulting or SCB.  It had to change its name because Paul Ripp was exposing this outfit to the voters and being a candidate with "Catalyst" on your filing form became a liability.
This is how SCB works in four easy to follow steps:
1. SCB recruits candidates and vets them to the developers.  
2. The developers then contribute to their campaigns.
3. The candidates pay SCB for campaign services.  
4. Once the candidates win, the newly elected politicians are OWNED by the developers and SCB makes money.

This is a modern form of a "Triangle Trade."  It is just this "mafia" is trading our homes and future.
Joe Davis, Jeb Ball are owned by the developers.  Asking them to protect county property with zoning against overdevelopment is like asking a pimp to protect the virginity of his harem.  The County Commissioners are beholding to their pimp developers - it is just that it is we citizens who taking it up the tailpipe.
