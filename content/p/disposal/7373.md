 There are few real men left in Fairhope.  The real men have moved east to Robertsdale and  Loxley.
The beta males in Fairhope are a bunch of wine sipping, sandal wearing, golf cart driving weenies who think their poo poo does not stink.   This will come in handy when their treatment plant breaks down and then they wonâ€™t have to smell it
