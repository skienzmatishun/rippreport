 There are more houses going in and stressing the swags system.   The last time it rained, Fairhope came near close to another washout 
The city utilities know all they have to do is notify the EPA, the EPA sends them a $10,000 bill, and the city just pay it. After all, what is a measly ten grand to a city that spends thousands times more on legal bills?
I swear, this council must be tossed out in 2020 before they turn this town into another Theodore.  Theodore has its industrial waste and Fairhope has its raw sewage.  Both can make you ill.
