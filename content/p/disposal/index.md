The President of the Fairhope City Council has held on to that title for over 7 years. This is extremely rare, most often Councils share the position of Council President with other Council members. Not Jack Burrell, he has to maintain “control”. His Control has been very costly for the City of Fairhope. His lack of leadership and his favoritism to special interests, CATALYST, is all to apparent.

Ask yourself, How can a Council President not know whose idea it was to “dispose” of 106 acres of city property, worth 20 million dollars? He knows, however Jack chose to lie to the entire council chambers claiming he forgot. WT F 20 million and he forgot who came up with the idea. HA

Fairhope wake the ---- up. This is insanity, and corrupt. Stop the Conservation Easement. All you coffee clubs and concerned citizens better wake up and fast.

Please remember it was Council President Burrell that led the City Council to override the Mayor’s veto over the Fly Creek extension of the zoning. It was also Burrell who settled the Triangle lawsuit and then told citizens it was a purchase of a park, another bare face lie.

The Fairhope City Council avoids public participation or community engagement when at all possible. Refusing citizens the opportunity to speak at public meetings got Mr Burrell and the City in a Federal Lawsuit, that they lost.

It does not make any difference what issue is before the Fairhope Council, conservation easement, Twin Beech land for recreation, the airport or K-1, the Council President time and time again represents special interests, opposes the Mayor and quashes community engagement.

Burrell and Councilman Boone favored the developer of Fly Creek apartments, over the citizens, by accepting a parcel of land that is wetlands and at the foot of the Fly Creek Hwy 98 culvert. Fairhope gets the liability and the developer walks. Jack arrange that it be the last item on the agenda at the last council meeting under Tim Kant who was a no show that night, CORRUPTION.

Conservation Easement? What a joke! Remember how the council wanted to develop a drainage gully?

It took a petition of over 2000 names to get the Council attention before they reluctantly withdrew their support. Fairhope citizens need to convince the City Council not to dispose of any City property until the scheduled land use plan is completed.

If Fairhope was keen to establish a Conservation Easement for a park or the maximum conservation protection of the land then they ignored a much better location closer to the bay, the Breland property. However Fairhope Council President Burrell and the council do not want you to know that story or the fact that they are in Court over the issue.

WHAT ABOUT THE KIDS?

The council has chosen to turn its back on the children that were counting on purchasing the Twin Beech road property. It was the staff and Mayor’s recommendation, supported by outside sources. The Council however said they all agree on Twin Beech Road but it cost to much. Remember folks they bought the soccer fields because it was the cheapest. That cost us over a million dollars to correct the grade, another million was wasted and then they never built the fields to specifications, such as sanitizing the soil. This ended up costing a staggering 5 million and neighbors have to deal with the soccer fields located in a residential neighborhood. Council President Burrell wants an appraisal on one side of town but wants to give away 20 million of land on the other side of town?????? This is not about money this is about quality of life and supporting a neighborhood that has been ignored and is being ignored again.

Citizen have to come together and fight for their neighborhood and community. Call the Council members and let them know you want the Twin Beech property and not to “ dispose” of 106 acres of city property.

Trust me I could give you a dozen more examples of Mr Burrell’s poor decisions as council President.

Last but certainly not least is the Police Report Mr. Burrell conveniently hid before the last election.
