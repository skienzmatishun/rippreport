 I’ll make a deal with you Georgia. You buy that property for half of what the asking price is now and I’ll pay you a 20% premium  above that price the same day. Recession!  Really?  I’ve seen some of your post. You are certainly not a financial advisor much less do you make much sense in any of your post. It will be a few years (if any at all) if a recession hits our part of the Country. Let’s be more concerned about who’s doing all the lying, cheating, stealing and belittling of women in Faihope. If we get rid of the garbage, we won’t have to worry about what we pay and certainly about what we might can pay. I think Burrell is peeing on your leg while telling you it’s raining. All you weak Faihope men that are such cowards. You should know we all watch you everyday. The real shame is that you don’t care what we think of you including your own family. Get with it Georgia. I’m terrible at posting but I’m not plain stupid at it.
