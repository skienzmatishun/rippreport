 I am no fan of Burrell (quite the contrary), but it appears that the owner of the Twin Beech property is asking 30 -40% over appraised value to sell it to the City.  As values right now are probably at ridiculously inflated values, we can probably pick that property up for half of the current asking price next year (as all economic signs and experts are pointing to an upcoming recession).  For the first time, I applaud the CC for not over paying as it normally does.

As to the triangle property, I think that if the CC 'gives it away' each member of the CC may be liable to to the taxpayers.  I'd be very careful here if I were on the Council.  I know that these guys don't know it but this is the 21st Century and they don't own the City.
