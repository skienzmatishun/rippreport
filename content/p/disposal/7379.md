 Perhaps you don't understand what an appraisal is.  The Appraiser takes into consideration similar properties and the prices for which those have sold (comps).  If a property is considered more 'choice', it appraises for a higher value.  Since the last recession, appraisal rules have been re-written so that 'opinions' don't make a difference.  Appraisals have become as scientific as possible so that we don't have a repeat of the Great Recession when property values had become so over-inflated and lenders were failing due to falling for 'opinions' of those who thought that values could never fall.
