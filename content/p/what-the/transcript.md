# Transcript

Paul Rip, a consumer advocate, is in Lisbon, Portugal, on research; a tornado hits the country the same day, adding absurdity. In March, Alabama Senator Katie Britt’s State of the Union speech, described as “dystopian,” drew SNL parody and criticism for lack of polish; no link exists to her being Trump’s VP pick. Biden misstated Georgia nursing student Larkin Riley’s name, prompting AG’s office to call for the Larkin Riley Act to strengthen ICE, and to suggest a new president is needed. Governor Kay Ivey signed the Choose Act, offering up to $7,000 tax credits for school transfers and $4,000 for homeschoolers; the act faces opposition from retirement and education groups but gains business support. Alabama passed a ban on taxpayer-funded DEI departments, expanding beyond CRT to prohibit “divisive concepts,” effective next school year despite a $9.4B education budget. A murder case in Madison County involves Kyle Luder, a Young Republicans chair, charged with killing his gay lover with a wooden dowel; the incident draws intense Republican scrutiny. Senate gaming bill allows only lottery-style gambling and authorizes KIV to negotiate with Porce Creek Band; no Class III gaming is permitted. House has not voted, and both chambers remain in limbo. On Feb. 24, an explosive device was placed outside the AG’s office in Montgomery; a surveillance video shows a man with a history of police beatings, raising transparency concerns. Rep. John Rogers, longest-serving House member, pleaded guilty to fraud in a community service fund, admitting to stealing $250,000—only serving 14 months in house arrest. U.S. Attorney Priam Escalata confirmed the conviction; prosecutors cited health issues and incompetence to stand trial. A police shooting in Decatur on March 11 involved Steve Perkins, who allegedly pointed a gun at an officer after a tow truck driver (at wrong house) claimed Perkins threatened him with a gun. Officers say Perkins had only a flashlight; body camera footage is under investigation. The incident sparked protests and demands for transparency; a joint press briefing was held, and Perkins’ family hired civil rights attorney Lee Merritt to pursue justice. Body cam footage was published by 1819 News, though Alia’s office confirms it was not released beyond the Morgan County DA. DA previously declined release in January, citing jury taint; in past cases, footage was shared with defense, DA, and investigators. The DA confirms only three parties—investigating agency, DA, and defense—typically access footage before trial. A proposed ethics bill would eliminate penalties for lawmakers violating ethics laws and grant a lifetime appointment to Ethics Commission director Tom Albritton, dubbed the “poster boy of corruption.” Critics argue local DAs rarely pursue state reps due to political ties. Senate would be required to reconfirm the director despite lifetime appointment. Alabama Supreme Court ruled in-vitro fertilized fetuses are persons for legal purposes. A pharmacy bill raises concerns as a pharmacist pushes back against misinformation; Amazon’s entry into pharmacy sector is linked to declining life expectancy amid $800B opioid settlement. Federal funds to states and localities exceed defense spending, prompting questions about fiscal accountability. Justice Department sues Apple, accusing it of exploiting iPhone data for surveillance and blocking rivals. In Haiti, a deposed president receives secret service protection, raising questions given RFK Jr. lacks such safeguards. Florida lawmaker’s mercy flight evacuates Port-au-Prince; Texas councilwoman’s arrest over misplaced document is deemed politically motivated. Georgia prosecutor files case against Trump; Babylon Bee ranks Camilla Harris as second-worst diversity hire. In Coffee County, an illegal immigrant accused of raping a 14-year-old mentally incapacitated girl drew condemnation from Senator Tuberville, who blamed Biden. Media misrepresents Trump’s Ohio speech warning of an auto industry “bloodbath.” Anti-drone companies sell radio jammers on Amazon, violating FCC rules. Senate Intelligence Committee holds repetitive, unproductive hearings on Russia and misinformation. A search warrant for a Little Rock, AR, residence tied to a white 2022 Toyota Highlander reveals Malinowski purchased 24 Glocks, nine Fed Arms, and other handguns from FFLs; an employee admitted buying via GunBroker, with AR rifles shipped directly. A separate incident involves the brother of Clinton International Airport’s head of security being shot in the head during a pre-dawn raid, reportedly returning fire and dying two days later. The FBI’s warrantless search of safe deposit boxes is challenged in federal court as violating the Fourth Amendment. A Louisiana Boeing worker at a South Carolina plant died by suicide after missing depositions; a whistleblower claims foul play, saying “if anybody ever finds me dead, I damn sure didn’t kill myself.” Stormy Daniels’ attorney Michael Avante is accused of extorting $20M from a major figure, allegedly with Michael Cohen. In Alabama, longtime sheriff’s association executive Bobby Timmons, known for defending concealed carry, died at 91. The state’s “Paperclip” operation brought Nazi rocket scientists to Huntsville; a reception on the mall marked a key moment. Greg Reed, Senate pro tem, highlights record-low unemployment (2.8%) and 33% of adults idle; state offers childcare tax credits and homebuilding incentives. A new cabinet will lead workforce development. The Murray Lawrence case remains pending; defendant, found guilty of fatally shooting a mobile officer, will face lethal injection. Mobile pushes for commercial air traffic and a $300M civic center despite better access from Pensacola and New Orleans. A March 28 shooting near Gulf Shores injured one, another in custody. Auburn University pays $1M annually to Matrix LLC, a political consulting firm; former Rep. Perio Hooper Jr. provided free consulting. The university hired Matrix to spy on Southern Company executives, prompting a lawsuit after former employees formed Canopy Partners. Several board members, including Kay Ivey and B.T., were implicated. The McCrary Institute at Auburn, established in 2010 with $10M endowment, focuses on cybersecurity and national security. Key figures include Zeke Smith, Quentin Riggins, and Nick Sellers. Lieutenant General Ron Burgess, former Defense Intelligence Agency director, now serves as executive in residence; the institute is tied to Alabama Power and funded by a $1M political consulting contract. Alum Mr. Still raised ethics concerns with Auburn’s Public Affairs Director Jennifer Wood Adams, who declined to comment. The campus security force, described as modern-day Pinkertons, is criticized for loyalty to power over principle; the host repeatedly expresses discomfort, warning that someone must answer for their actions.
