From the darling of Alabama political circles to SNL target, Senator Katie Britt is in the news. The Gaming Bill, Medical Cannabis, School Choice, Alabama Works, A New Ethics Law and much more has been going on in Montgomery as the Legislature grinds. There was a leaked police body cam depicting the events that led to charges against the officer. And the most "What The" story is the love triangle between Alabama Power Company current and former executives, The Matrix LLC, and the McCrary Institute (aka the Military Industrial Complex on campus) at Auburn University. A one million dollar contact and as Alumni your hosts are not amused.
