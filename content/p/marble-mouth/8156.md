 My guess is that Kant died and left Jackass Burell “King” and the Council are his Court Jesters. 
This corrupt group of men continue to create more controversy and havoc on the lives of the citizens of Fairhope who own property there. 
I hope that everyone will remember at voting time the decisions they have made and continue to do. On top of that, there is absolutely no reason to spend the dollars that BELONG to us in these ways. It is irresponsible. 

I, for one, plan to put the word out on them election time.
 
If you are an honest, civic minded person- please run for a place on the City Council so that we can get make the infrastructure a priority. 
Thank you!
