 We all have known that for years!!!
Jack Burrell, Tucker Dorsey and  Chris Elliot are on the list to GO!
They all wear God on their sleeves and tell you what great Christians they are. Well, that's exactly what hypocrites do. Don't tell me you are a Christian. SHOW me that you are. None of the above certainly are not good examples of being a Christian at all or even a capable of acting like a decent person.  God has taken care of Pittman and the rest will follow. I just pray he doesn't take as long as he did with Trip Pittman. But!  He did show us just how terrible a person can be and how they can take advantage if placed in such a position. You go boy, only 7% of the statewide votes Trip Pittman received. Stevie Wonder could can even see how terrible these people are and that's not all of them. Change is a coming!
