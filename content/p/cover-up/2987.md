 Does anyone know what number/percentage of votes each of the candidates received from Baldwin/Mobile County voters?   Just curious if Pittman received any support here or if everyone knew what he had done in the past.   He ran against the worst crop of candidates I have ever seen; I almost voted for him  because it was a difficult choice to ascertain which of the options was less dishonest.  I decided that, even if Pittman isn't the worst in the field, he is definitely the one that has done to most to destroy Fairhope and its environment. Easy choice.
