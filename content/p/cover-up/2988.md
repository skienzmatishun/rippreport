 Hester, did you attend the last City Council meeting?  Jack Burrell expressed his regrets about the massive sewage spill that was (in his words) 'unavoidable'.  As Council President, he needs to admit some culpability here; I hope that you are right that he is in his end game!  I see his power slipping daily, and never more than when he blew off concerns of Fairhope residents that the sewage problems are 'unavoidable'.  I hope that the day arrives when Kant, Burrell &amp; Boone answer questions under oath (and sober).
