 Georgia Orwell.....After verifying with the Baldwin County Probate election of record for votes cast in the Republican US Senate race the results are as follows: Baldwin CO.

Luther Strange 32%
Roy Moore  30%
Trip Pittman  22%
Mo Brooks  14 %
Trip Pittman would not have made the run off even if just Baldwin County Voted. Damn Shame. But maybe the few that voted for him will realize how terrible he is.
