 He must be so embarrassed.  I think that he truly believed that he would win...talk about tone-deaf to what everyone thinks of him.  I know that a lot of his former fraternity brothers voted for him; of course, they don't live here and are clueless about his BP fraud. I don't know a single person in Fairhope who admitted to voting for him.
