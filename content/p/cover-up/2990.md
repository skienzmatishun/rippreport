 I am glad the full time mayor, the executive officer of the city, is totally in the clear on all the sewage spill(s).  I am glad the physical plant director who directly oversees all this as his full time job, is totally without blame.

It is everyone's fault to a degree and I think the mayor , council, and physical plant director are all doing a good job attacking the problem. Hope you complainers won't mind paying much higher taxes and fees to pay for all the work that will need to be done.
