 Trip Pittman barley got 25,000 votes State wide. Not sure exactly how many Baldwin County votes he got. But at 7% of the state. I really don't give a crap. Sorry I did not give you a complete answer. Not being disrespectful or being a butt. If it was held just in Baldwin Couny I heard that there would have still been a run off. So long to Pittman and all his (very few) supporters!!! Now we can start getting the Pittman smell out of the air!
