# Transcript

At 1:39 a.m., two Alabama deputies responded to a man in dark clothing and a hoodie near an abandoned store in Perdido. Identified as “the man with flowers,” he produced a handgun and fired at least one shot, prompting return fire. The shooting lasted under four minutes, resulting in his death on scene. Both deputies, unharmed, are on administrative leave as body and dash cam footage is under investigation.  

In Tallisey, Mayor Darnell Smith was arrested for first-degree domestic violence—attempted murder via strangulation—and previously convicted of road rage. He is running for the Public Service Commission seat held by Twinkle Cavanaugh. In Baldwin County, residents face mandatory expensive ankle monitors for low-level offenses, a practice enabled as a workaround to banned debtors’ prison. Critics say it punishes nonviolent offenders with steep fines and court costs. Advocates including Hoss Mack and his group of married men, along with DA Bob Wilfors’ office, support the policy.  

Brookside, a town of 1,400, earns half its revenue from fines and forfeitures. From 2016 to 2020, citations surged 692%, with 4.4 arrests per household in 2020. Police patrolled 114,000 miles and issued 3,000 citations. They operate a Bradley-style armored truck with a gun turret. Under Title 45, Local Law 45 284.02, the Community Corrections Board includes sheriff, DA, and circuit clerk. In 2020, 3,000 citations were issued by splitting drug possession and paraphernalia into separate charges—e.g., a left-handed “lucky” in an ashtray led to two charges. Smaller amounts were charged as multiple misdemeanors, inflating stats. With only nine officers for 1,253 residents (one per 139), staffing appears minimal. A job posting humorously noted a need for “strong wrists” to handle paperwork. Election cycle: May 24 primary, June 21 runoff, November 8 general, with registration deadlines ending January 28 at 5 PM.  

Voter registration must be verified early—ideally days before voting. Baldwin County’s $65M jail tower project continues, with public hearings canceled due to Omicron. Alabama reports a 45% COVID positivity rate—highest nationally—with 3 million new infections this week. Officials are accused of manipulating data visuals to avoid a “blood red” map. State reports 2,249 new cases (up from 2,500 the prior week), two new deaths.  

Mo Brooks, seeking a U.S. Senate run, has ties to Roy Moore but authored only two lost Senate bills. Critics call him a career politician focused on re-election. The “Lanyap” cover story notes 2022 legislative efforts will be shaped by statewide elections and shifting House leadership. Jack Burrell, a key negotiator, was absent from a crucial meeting, delaying Continental Aerospace’s deal with the Fair Airport Authority until March 31.  

The Permitless Carry Bill, championed by Rep. Shane Stringer, drew attention. Stringer, previously fired as a sheriff’s deputy for proposing it, now faces opposition from all sheriffs who stand to lose $30 per permit—$9,000 annually, or enough to fund 26,000 prisoners. The issue is not gun rights but lost revenue. The legislature allocated $772M: $270M broadband, $151M healthcare, $225M water/sewer, $20M fire/emergency, $11M jail reimbursements. A new billion-dollar funding wave—expected May/June—is projected to be more valuable than last year’s. Questions may arise over fund use. The Lanny app’s “Green State” series highlights confusion in medical marijuana licensing—California requires $1.5M bank capital to qualify, despite federal illegality.  

Anaya’s Law, passed in January, raises non-capital murder bail from $150,000 to $1.5 million. In Davon Bray’s case, 10% of $1.5M is $150,000—making release nearly impossible for someone already out on $200,000 bond.  

William Ray Norris, former Clark County sheriff, was indicted for campaign finance violations, abuse of office, and income tax evasion after resigning in May 2021 following impeachment. He surrendered and was released on $50,000 bond. Despite 5,000 alleged felonies, AG’s office prioritized tax evasion, drawing criticism for inaction on sexual harassment and abuse of force.  

Alabama receives 37.5% of Gulf of Mexico Security Act (GoMESA) funds—17 coastal projects received $41M last year. Mississippi, despite casino gaming, gets no funds because it bans oil exploration in its 8-mile territorial waters. The host criticizes lack of oversight.  

In Baldwin County, 20% of planning applications are for RV parks, many in unzoned areas like Fair Hill. Driven by high rental costs and population growth, these developments raise concerns over traffic, utilities, and stormwater. A key vote on expanding planning jurisdiction occurs February 15, affecting three districts, including one near the beach.  

A group in Mobile promotes “organic free-range grass-smoked human” as a food product—claimed by the “Ethical Treatment of Animals” group. The host jokes that if humans tasted good, feral hogs or human consumption might be more accepted. He notes people prefer wasabi over humans, suggesting humans don’t taste good.  

James Gordon reports on concerns that infrastructure can’t handle the surge. The episode ends with a reminder to watch for clues and hope Mr. Rip returns. Host thanks listeners and promises next time.
