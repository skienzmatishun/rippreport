 The County Commission is letting the developers run wild in the county.  Joe Davis and Jeb Ball are bought and paid for by the developers.  Catalyst OWNS these two.
Then when the people who bought the houses in the county subdivisions need the hospitals, they overload Thomas Hospital, South Baldwin Hospital, and North Baldwin Hospital.
The cities (not Daphne - Daphne is run by real estate developers like Haygood) try to control the growth but the developers go out in the county and overbuild.
Some developers happen to own land in the police jurisdiction and do not like the cities controlling their overbuilding.  That is why they are running to Elliot to get him to try to roll back the police jurisdictions.
When the hospitals can no longer take patients living in the city limits because they are booked up with people living OUTSIDE the city limits, people will suffer and may die due to lack of medical resources.  Their deaths will be on Catalyst's head.
