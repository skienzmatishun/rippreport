 I was encouraged to see both Skip Jones and John Manelos step up and tell Jack Burrell, publicly, that this cannot be done just because 'Jack says so'.  Many others have protested but this Council is notorious for shooting down anyone that protests its agenda.  Jones and Manelos both are far more respected than any of this Council, which puts them out of Burrell's bullying reach,  so I am hoping that we are safe for the moment.  Meantime, let's hope that Fairhope voters remember that Diana Brewer and Jack Burrell have brought us this awesome deal to give away the triangle property.......surely, it must be a Godsend for Fairhope taxpayers, right?  Brewer was justly voted off the CC for demanding that the Fly Creek Apartments be approved.....I am betting big that she and Jack and Corte have BIG plans for the triangle property.  Most people probably would believe that putting it into a conservancy would save it from development; it won't. Check out Mattie Kelly's will in Destin, Florida and what happened to the property that she had put into a conservancy to be protected forever!  It did not end up in the way that she had planned.  Don't trust Jack.
