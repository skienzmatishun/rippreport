 You may be correct. Next door neighbor just stepped over to tell us her husband who was released Sunday had to go back to Hospital this morning and needed to be admitted but they did not have a room  they had been in the Energency Room all day!! There is SOMETHING Wrong in this town !  Hope for those that are turning their heads the other way for someone else to deal with it donâ€™t have a loved one that needs attention but there is no room or  may be no one is listening. Guess there will have to be MAJOR DISASTERS BEFORE SOMEONE WAKES UP !!!!
