 Catalyst is already working its schemes.   Elliot is trying to get a bill psssed where cities have to roll back their extraterritorial jurisdictions.
Elliot cites the reason is that people living outside the city limits are being told what to do by elected officials they did not vote for
The REAL reason is that the developers want to overbuild just outside the cities without any impact fees then dump the extra people in the city schools, overuse the sewers, crowd the roads and book up the hospitals 
Just today Thomas Hospitals had people stay in the ER because the patient rooms were taken up
What these builders are being allowed to do us now threatening the lives of the residents 
Developers, may you rot in Hell
