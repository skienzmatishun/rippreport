 As long as the developers contribute gobs of payments to certain elected officials in forms of campaign contributions, expect more of the same.
As more and more developers start dumping apartments in neighborhoods only then will the residents of those neighborhoods start fighting back.  But by then it will be too late.  The people only have themselves to blame for allowing this.  This overbuilding is happening right under our noses and NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE ARE RAISING ENOUGH HELL ABOUT IT.
The only mistake the developers did was build those Fly Creek Apartments too close to Rock Creek and the Woodlands - kind of like being too close to a nerve.
Well, now we know the organized destruction - it is called Catalyst.  This outfit is made of developers who pay elected officials' campaign money to get in office to approve the overbuilding.  What are we going to do about it?
