 I grew up in the area and this should have been stopped years ago. I work  heavy construction and travel around the country. When I tell people where I'm from they "We used to go there all the time, before it got so crowded". GS and OB have killed the goose that laid the golden egg. People of GS need to get ride of this mayor and council. Or just appoint Meyers and Kaiser.  Another bad move is the city schools you got rail roaded into. Wait two years and then look at your taxes.
