 You are so correct. I used to go to almost every Council meeting and have attended some of the more controversial Board of Adjustments meetings, but I have pretty much given up.  These "Bozo's" don't care at all about what effect their actions have on Fairhope taxpayers/residents.  When they ignore us and cast votes to destroy the City and its beauty, they may not be taking cash kickbacks, but I'd bet my dog that 'something nice has come their way'.  I hope that they can live with themselves after ignoring masses showing up at meetings to protest their actions.
