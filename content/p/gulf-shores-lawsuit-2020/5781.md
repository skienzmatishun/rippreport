 I feel that Gulf Place is pretty to look at but not very functional. For example, parking space was eliminated in order to provide for a meandering concrete walkways (Agenda 21/30/40?).  Also gone are the sheltered picnic tables at both ends of the boardwalk and the row of individual sheltered picnic tables in the island separating the two parking lots that were eliminated. The new restroom are certainly welcome, however, the capacity has not changed which has a much larger impact on women than men.  Finally I miss the traditional, straight boardwalk as opposed to the curvy, concrete walkway that replaced it.

It appears to me that the intention of the planners was to discourage folks from the surrounding areas to commute to this public beach by turning it into a non-functional showpiece to be used primarily by those living or vacationing within in walking distance of this public beach.
