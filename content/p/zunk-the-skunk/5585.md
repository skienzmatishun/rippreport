 I went to that meeting. Zunk is sketchy for sure. They say this doesn't have to do with politics yet the people pushing "council at large" down our throats are Zunk (too many former boards to mention), ex-councilmen Kingrea, Stankowski, Mixon, Gentle and ex-councilwoman Brewer. Y'all were voted out for a reason!  Your opinion has no weight in this community anymore. 

Anyone who announces to a crowd of people, "Only listen to me!" Who the hell does he think he is and how many people has he brainwashed?

I'm in favor a Council/Manager form of government because of DISTRICTS and the end of slates!!!!  Our Mayor is for this too! Good for her.
