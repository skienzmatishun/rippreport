 I attended the last two meetings and I don't see it as a move against the Mayor.  The objective is to have a professional City Manager (as Vestavia, Mountain Brook, Auburn and other cities have) rather than have this constant bickering among the Mayor and Council, none of whom have any experience at managing a huge budget much of which is squandered by inept employees who are unaware of laws.  It seems to be a move for the better for Fairhope and its taxpayers.  The only ones that I can imagine being in opposition are Council members who like to line their own pockets and employees who believe themselves incompetent and unlikely to hold onto their positions when evaluated by a professional manager.  It should be great for any Mayor who is not exploiting his/her position.  If she is in favor of this change, why are some so upset about it and why is she arguing with Zunk (who appears to be intelligent and sincerely trying to volunteer his time and energy to do something good for the City)?   No one has promised anyone that Council members will be at-large or zoned; I prefer at-large, but anything is better than this dog and pony show Council and Mayor war that prevents any of them from doing anything purposeful for the City.
