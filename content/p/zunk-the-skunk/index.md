I could smell the skunk through my computer, the first time that I read, Chuck Zunk, was agreeing with the Mayor of Fairhope, on the Council-manager form of government.

Mr Zunk was appointed to the finance committee by the council, Jack Burrell, to monitor, and financially obstruct the Mayor, and take over the budget process, that did not fly.

Please remember Zunk’s connection to the Airport scandal and dubious airplane hanger lease. He stands firmly behind Jack’s efforts to be sure the Airport property stays with the Airport Authority, instead of the city who paid for it.

It is well known around City Hall and the Community that Mr Zunk will use every opportunity, public and private, to attack the Mayor. This animosity comes from the Airport Scandal, hopefully Mr Zunk will have to raise his hand in court one day and answer some very difficult questions involving Jack and the Airport. Fairhope breeds bullies, especially bullies that pick on women.

Something just was not right so I went to the public meeting, called by Mr Zunk, last night at the library, but first I read From the desk of Mayor Wilson, the City’s position and petition.

Council-Manager Form of Government JUNE 21, 2018 COMMUNITY

Do I support this new form of government for the City of Fairhope? Absolutely

Should citizens be concerned about the timing of this effort? No. The discussion about the Council-Manager form of government has been talked about for many years and I have been researching it with a few citizens since the beginning of the year. After the new amendment passed this past April, a group of citizens have come together to discuss how it works. I believe this form of government is a better way for Fairhope’s future.

The administrative role of mayor currently is a full-time job leaving little time for planning and vision which I believe is one of the most important roles of a mayor. We have had City Administrators in the past who have helped with this role with far less population, however the position was defunded years ago. By changing the form of government, the City Manager would be the consistent professional through terms managed by The New Council (defined below). Our future is too important to leave this position up for debate.

The petition being circulated is simply supporting a citizen vote to take place 90 days after it’s turned in on or before July 5th and would not take effect until next term, 2020. This is not about supporting or not supporting elected officials in office right now, rather a [Fresh Start for Fairhope](http://freshstartfairhope.com/). Why I support the Council-Manager form of government:

It takes the day-to-day administrative role out of the political limelight which has been very detrimental to not only our City but others also still operating under the Council-Mayor form of government. This is not about taking anyone’s side (mayor or council), it is about a more professional way of doing business for our City and our employees – a better way to represent our citizens and meet their needs.

The New Council under the Council-Manager form of government provides for an at-large representation via the mayor and one councilperson and three council members elected specifically by the residents of three voting districts.

The petition, which is prescribed by the state, needs to be at the Probate Judge’s office on July 5th {update 6/21 11:30am} Petition Deadline is Sat, June 29th. We will be taking up the petitions Friday, end of day June 28th at City facilities.} Judge Tim Russell will also be speaking during the mayor’s report at council meeting on June 25th. You may be interested in hearing what he says and his guidance.

Your friends and neighbors will be circulating the petitions, and copies will also be available at the library, Quail Creek clubhouse and City Hall. Following petition was approved by the Secretary of State’s office. If a min 10% of registered voters from the last municipal election are qualified on the petition, citizens will have an opportunity to vote for the new form of government in 90 days.

I believe Sam Gaston says it best, “If you hire a professional manager, you will have less politics in city government.” He is the City Manager of Mountain Brook for the past 25 years and a descendant of E.B. Gaston, founder of Fairhope.

You can meet Mr Gaston at the meeting Thursday, June 21st at the library to discuss this new form of government more.


## READ THIS AGAIN:

“The New Council under the Council-Manager form of government provides for an at-large representation via the mayor and one councilperson and three council members elected specifically by the residents of three voting districts.”

## NOW READ THIS

“The petition signed by the people will automatically form districts. I clarified this through legal and Judge Tim Russell. I’ve invited him to discuss the facts during my mayor report at Monday’s council meeting. The attached petition is the one that was approved. Regardless of a distinction (at large or by district), the petition is simply for citizens to vote for the new form of government and there is no way citizens can amend it to “members at large”.

Mayor Karin Wilson

Fairhope City Council meeting June 25th at 6:00pm

How could anyone not understand what the position of the Mayor is?

{{< socialpreview url="https://www.lagniappemobile.com/news/group-gathering-signatures-for-new-government-in-fairhope/article_eb25f147-5c43-5570-8c7a-6e612c72aff4.html" >}}

Zunk the skunk has his own variation of the petition,

“Thanks for your votes on At-Large vs Districts, we had 65 total votes with the majority of 39 (60%) for At-Large, so that's how we will move forward. Many of you included an explanation of your reasoning, which I was very pleased to read. You have done your homework!” ZUNK the SKUNK explained. Zunk the Skunk is not the only skunk in Baldwin county.

{{< socialpreview url="https://rippreport.com/p/catalyst-skunk/" >}}

You should smell a foul smell about this time. Mr Zunk through his survey of 65 people has now decided that the 39 people is all he needs to change the petition from districts to at large. WOW 39 people out of 20,000 is all the skunk needs to push HIS agenda and petition, which HAS NOT been approved by the Probate Judge or Sec. Of State.

Zunk slipped this in last night to an unsuspecting crowd. Mr Zunk asked the crowd if they had any questions? When the Mayor got up to clarify what was being said, Zunk the Skunk instructed the crowd, “listen to me not her” cut the Mayor off, and did not render the microphone. Zunk has learned well from Burrell, deny people and the Mayor the ability to exercise the right of Free Speech.

{{< socialpreview url="https://rippreport.com/p/see-ya-in-court-jack/" >}}

## FEDERAL COURT

At that point the crowd was evacuating the auditorium at full speed, the skunk smell was so foul paint was peeling off the walls.

Zunk’s plan is to keep the Council AT LARGE why? Because the Catalyst group has failed to get the Mayor to resign and they see Burrell as damaged goods. Zunk’s, alternative group, comprised of councilman that have been voted out of office, think they are the new salvation. They know the Council must stay AT LARGE in order for Zunk’s, alternative group, to organize a slate of candidates for the next election.

**Fairhope’s major problem is the AT LARGE Council, it has not worked in 20 years, why do the same damn thing again? The Districts prevent alternative groups from forming candidate slates. The districts give citizens someone to hold accountable, their representative. The skunk plan holds no one accountable, they are AT LARGE.**

If this does not work we go back to the drawing board. Fairhope needs citizens to step up to public service. The present council will be lucky if they survive this term, they will not be re-elected. Fairhope needs candidates not affiliated with the past but are looking forward.

Fairhope’s needs to replace the self serving B’s, they are the problem.

## PLEASE SIGN THE APPROVED PETITION, NOT THE ONE THAT STINKS

## THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THE FAIRHOPE COMMUNITY
