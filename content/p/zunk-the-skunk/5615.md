 That is totally unsourced information; you are no better than Jackass Burrell when you channel Fox Friends and lie.  This is an important move for our city; please don't lie and try to encourage strife.  Everyone should look at both petitions and decide which they want to sign; I would love to know why the Mayor and Chuck Zunk did not resolve this before they both floated petitions. Clarification, anyone???
