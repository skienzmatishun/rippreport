 Burrell, Boone, Brown, Conyers &amp; Robinson show their true colors at every Council Meeting.  They are all so full of themselves it is quite laughable.  Talk to people all over the country &amp; Fairhope is not thought of like it use to be.  Do not kid yourselves - Burrell, Boone &amp; Brown have ruined Fairhope as has the former Mayor.  More will be coming out.  This is Fraud City..
