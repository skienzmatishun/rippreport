 It was clear tonight that the current Council members are totally opposed to the new form of government, which seems counter-intuitive in that their jobs would be a breeze if this passes.  Robinson and Conyers were great, but the three B's were clear that they are not in favor of changes which hints to me that they are going to lose their alternative revenue sources if this passes?  I hate that Tim Russell didn't show up but he apparently has made it clear that the two petitions are equal and they may be combined.  Mayor Wilson has stepped up totally in contrast to the coin-operated Council.  Does anyone know how many signatures there are yet on her petition?  And how do we get more?  I read that Robert Brown is stressed out about these petitions being available to sign downtown.
