 I don’t believe anyone has said they are not running again. When it’s time maybe one or more will decide that. All of them earn more than the Mayor will/would. I can’t see any of them running for Mayor in the present setup. Even if they were elected if they were not re-elected they would be unemployed 4 years later. I think the mayor is as likely to “retire”as anyone given how stressed she has been less than halfway through her term. But right now we have about 27 more months with the same people so let’s hope some progress is made. The grants we have been getting are really going to help, even with the airport. I am not for the city owning the airport. If they want to sell it great.  All we need is some kind of accident and the city get sued for millions. It is one of the few ways the city could be bankrupted.

I see plenty of problems but I feel they are all being addressed.

I wonder if enlarging the council ( and reducing their pay proportionally) would work. It would allow more voices. I have no bias for or against districts. Pity the person who draws the boundaries  if they use districts.
