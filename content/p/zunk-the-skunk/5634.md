 Wow, Gerald, that certainly is a mouthful you wrote.  But you are correct.  I live in "Old Fairhope" and have lived for years.  It is a rotten shame of what has happened to this town.  A few greedy people have moved in, gotten into office, and have ruined it.  But we should blame ourselves for letting this happen.

Yes, growth is good, but this growth has proven to be a cancer.
