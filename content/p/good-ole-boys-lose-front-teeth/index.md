summary: Baldwin County is seeing a shift from the good ole boy, GOB, culture to a transparent and accountable government. This election has shown that citizens of Baldwin County are fed up with the blatant corruption. Catalyst, aka Scott Boone Consulting, the political promoter of GOB now has the attention of the public. A Catalyst candidate is a GOB candidate, plain and simple. The GOB and Catalyst lost some front teeth in this election.

Baldwin County is seeing a shift from the good ole boy, GOB, culture to a transparent and accountable government. This election has shown that citizens of Baldwin County are fed up with the blatant corruption.

Catalyst, aka Scott Boone Consulting, the political promoter of GOB now has the attention of the public. A Catalyst candidate is a GOB candidate, plain and simple. The GOB and Catalyst lost some front teeth in this election.

## BAY MINETTE

The ex-Mayor of Bay Minette, the county seat, Bob Wills lost to Joshua Brown along with two incumbent council seats. Bad mouth Bob is going to need dentures. Something tells me the police chief may want to go with Bobby for those dentures. This is a major blow to GOB, let’s see how they react with mid-term creeping up.

Karma can be a bitch! Remember a Catalyst candidate is a GOB candidate.
It is a new day in Bay Minette, congratulations to Mayor Brown.

## SPANISH FORT

The Spanish Fort voters slapped the dentures right out of “slappin Mike’s” mouth.

Mayor Brad Bass won a resounding victory with three times the votes Mike got.

Karma causes tooth decay.

## SUMMERDALE

It has been 17 years since Summerdale voters placed a single vote for Mayor. Mayor Randy Farris changed that and WON. Congratulations.

## ROBERTSDALE

Eight term incumbent Mayor Charlie Murphy finished third leaving the race to a run-off between Ruthie Campbell and Russell Johnson. A new Mayor is coming to Robertsdale and the GOB just lost another tooth.

Let’s hope they establish term limits in future mayor and council terms.

GOB did much better in Fauxhope, their headquarters, as well as Gulf Shores and Orange Beach, that’s the next story.
