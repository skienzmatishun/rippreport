 Hightower used Catalyst back in 2016 when he ran for governor.   I had it on good info that back then that he was disappointed in Booneâ€™s outfit but Hightower is using Catalyst again because he was promised to get big contributions from Cox and the other real estate developers that fund Catalyst 
If Hightower comes to this part of the state I will ask him about why he has sold out to Catalyst
