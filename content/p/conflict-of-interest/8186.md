 I knew Hightower was Catalyst when I saw his campaign signs.  Like the rest of the Catalyst signs, the signs are square and the frames frames of the signs ere made of PVC pipe.
This allows a mass-production of the erection of the Catalyst signs.  The signs may be of different colors for each Catalyst candidate, but the size, shape, and frames are all the same.
I guess it is because Baby Boone is either too lazy to make different signs for his differing clients, or is too cheap to get REAL signs.
