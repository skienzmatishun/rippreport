 I talk to most of the "Fairhope Blue Bloods" I call them, folk who have lived here most if not all their lives. They all say the mayor "is crazy" and we "have to get rid of her!" 
These questionable Fairhopeers remind me of the democrats who only want to get rid of Trump, when we know he is doing good.

I say give Karin four more years so we can fix our infrastructure (late to the game) and get a new council.  We need more women in my humble opine.
