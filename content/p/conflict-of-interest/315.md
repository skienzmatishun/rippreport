 Sunday...I am so used to hearing the overhead traffic from Fairhope Airport daily that I ignore it until today.  A friend commented on the fact that the air is totally quiet....IT REALLY IS and has been for several days.  The small aircraft Sunday maneuvers are gone and I dont even see the usual rescue helicopter skimming the bay.  Are they all hiding till we forget we have an airport controversy??  What's up with that???
