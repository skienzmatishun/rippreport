 The airport is essential to every community, business and individuals that travel by private aircraft. You will never see any area that thrives without an airport. There are also several businesses located at the airport that provides many quality jobs for the area. You also have a great deal of people that fly in to Fairhope for vacations and to spend money in Fairhope. The only problem with the airport has been the lack of transparency with the authority. 

The airport is a great asset for the town and the county. The investments made at the airport are needed. It just needs to be fair and open to everyone that wants to participate in the investment. No one serving on the authority board should be allowed to participate in any bidding that would benefit them in anyway. That has been the case here and evidently in other situations in the city also.
