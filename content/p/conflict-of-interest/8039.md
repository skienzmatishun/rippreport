 It’s not the town I grew up in in the 1970’s
This was once a wholesome town where the cops were our neighbors and the people were hardworking
Now the cops just want fine bust people and fine them so they can get money to buy cool tactical gear and big SUV’s.   
It is a town full of overpaid greedy people wanting more money by selling their souls and then wish it was Mayberry
With all this confusion in their over educated minds do you see why they are hooked on prescription drugs?
Just go by Walgreens and see the long lines of people getting their next fix...
