 New roads?  What new roads?  We will get the roads AFTER we pay more gas taxes.
See? WE have to pay for the growth not the developers.  We long time citizens have been paying for the infrastructure all these years then the home builders come in, overwhelm the infrastructure and we have to pay again for the growth that they caused and they made money off of.
Ask any politician if they are for impact fees.  They will tell you "NO" because that is what they are told by Catalyst who buys the politicians and gets them elected.  Catalyst is a filthy outfit that is costing us money now and from now on.
I loved Frank Burt until I heard him say he was against impact fees. He says all impact fees do is raise the price of a home by several thousand dollars.  I say, "Let the growth pay for growth!"  No impact fees raise the price of ALL of our homes by just as much!
