 I think while we are at it we should insist they vote on city continuing to fund the Airport for another 7 years to the tune of $325,000 per year ($2,275,000 total). Let's not forget we've already been assisting them for the past 10 years. There is ZERO benefit to the city. No tax breaks. No return on investment. No ownership. 
Considering 3 council persons recused themselves from voting this week I think it only right to A's for another vote and insist Burrell recuse himself (he sits in the Airport Board); and any council person who accepted campaign contributions from the airport in the past 12 months should also recuse themselves. 
Furthermore, if they do agree to vote they must provide a deceleration plan of support to force the Airport to stop relying on the City.
