 Hightower is using Catalyst because of the donations he is getting from the donors.  The donors who fund Catalyst are the big developers.  The developers “donate” money in forms of political contributions to the politicians in return for favorable laws.  Catalyst serves as the conduit by vetting the candidates and getting them elected.
