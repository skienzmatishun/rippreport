 I heard that the city moratorium on development (new) is now over. What is the planning commission and council's position on growth? Is the city ready for new houses and more cars and people and kids and pets? This is starting to get out of hand just to make money for real estate folk. I don't know how Fairhope will be when we hit 50k. We are over forty now.
