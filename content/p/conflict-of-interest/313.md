 My father had one of the first consumer groups in Alabama formed in the 70's. He said that a consumer group was a watchdog for the people. When it comes to the Judiciary or political issues, the same is true. The Ripp Report has accomplished it's main goal,  Using the Court of Public Opinion to pressure politicians to do their job. The Ripp Report is a non-profit,  no salaries, and not obligated to any individual, group or PAC. When you are an elected official you have specific duties that would not allow you the freedom to criticize or investigate other elected officials,betrayal of public trust or corruption. They seem to protect each other, The Ripp Report will remain independent.
