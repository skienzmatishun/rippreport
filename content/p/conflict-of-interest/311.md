 They mayor can't vote on this but she has certainly voiced her opinion. She announced during a council meeting that the ordinance needed to be repealed and was responsible for having the development voted down by planning!

She is also the one that made the airport story and debt transparent to the citizen. If she didnt no one would know what was going on out there!  She asked the council to vote to take back the land bit they didn't listen and all voted to keep land in airport's name AND approved another 7 year commitment with no strings attached!

I think credit needs to be given where credit is due.  Our mayor is draining the swamp. Get behind her and stop throwing her under the bus with council. 

And as far as "family property?" This family owns most of Fairhope. No loss there.
