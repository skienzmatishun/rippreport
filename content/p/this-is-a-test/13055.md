 But Jack is a Christian Conservative.  Heck he leads prayer in the Methodist Church while the rest of Catalyst has infiltrated the other churches in Fairhope - like the Baptist Church, Lutheran, Catholic, Episcopal (heck Conners and Eliot are leading Bible study there)  and Presbyterian churches.
The congregations in these churches do not know they have been infiltrated by money-grubbing developers.  They have turned the churches into virus-infected voting groups.
Then to think why I do not go to these churches -  because Satan has infected them and the people do not know that false prophets have been controlling them....
