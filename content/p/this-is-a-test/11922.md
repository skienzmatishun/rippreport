 The mainstream media is dead.  The Mobile Prejudice Register is a joke.   If any “journalist” who works for the Register is reading this I ask you:   How can you sleep at night knowing you write brain vomit?   Once your paper was a great publication.  Now it cannot sell copies at Walmart.   If yuh had any pride or self worth, you would have found other work.  But since you are deep in debt with student loans that paid for your journalism school tuition, you are a prisoner to your sorry jobs.  
Why don’t you yiu work for a REAL paper like the Lagniappe?
