Today the Summerdale candidate forum will feature the good ole boys, and women of Baldwin County, infighting and dividing alliances. It seems Catalyst has stained the name of Scott Boone Consulting aka Catalyst, and some of his loyalists are wanting a divorce. Scott Boone is Lowery’s campaign manager, which should come as no surprise.

Jon Gray is working with Scott Boone on Kristy Haygood’s campaign. Gray is a long time friend of Haygood, let’s see how this threesome works. The last thing constituents want is Jon Gray anywhere near our already corrupt judicial system. Gray is also representing Frances “WOKE” Jones. The entire community of Fort Morgan have raised 10.000 thousand dollars to get rid of Jones who has disappointed constituents and what her replaced.

Kristy Haygood is featured in an upcoming book about the wrongful conviction of Murray Lawrence Jr. Her legal mistakes will be featured very soon. She is the pick of District Robert Wilters, also complicit in the same case. The mistakes she made in her Rule 32 filing in Mr. Lawrence’s case disqualifies her for a position of judge,

And in this corner we have Judge Jodi Bishop, Judge Scott and Jeremiah Giles Teamed up against Scott Boone, Jon Gray and Haygood. My VOTE goes for Jeremiah Giles hands down. Boone, Gray and Haygood cannot be trusted.

Meanwhile Judge Taylor is supporting Matt McMckenzie which has pissed off Lowery and Hoss Mack. Taylor kicked Scott Boone to the curb, Boone has become too toxic and some candidates want nothing to do with him. Many feel if you are a Scott Boone aka Catalyst Candidate, then you are the candidate NOT to vote for.

Don’t be surprised if you don’t see Hoss, The Boss Mack show up to try and control the sh-- show by Scott Boone, Lowery and candidates who need Mack to help get their feet out of their mouths. Mack has lost power and does not live in Baldwin County anymore. Lowery cannot hold onto power and has deputies praying for his removal.

Chris Elliott has had a breakup with Jon Gray and Eddie Tyler. Now Gray, once Elliott campaign manager, is working with Eddie Tyler to get rid of Elliott. Damn this is a crazy county. I agree with Tyler and Gray, kick Elliott’s sorry ass to the curb.

Summerdale tonight will be better than T.V. Come Watch politicians smile while they try to cut each other’s throat. Keep your back against the wall when talking with Scott Boone, Lowery, Donna or Elliott. Remember Jon Gray will represent anyone who can pay his fee.

This political season in Baldwin County is going to go down in the record books.

This Facebook post shows just what lengths the good ole boys and women of Baldwin County are willing to go to in order to elect the selected. That includes back stabbing one another. Donna Givens has been in overdrive to embarrass herself as well as Chris Elliott. Both should be shown the exit door. Elliott is a real snake, no one trusts him.

Earlier this evening, [Rep. Donna Black Givens](https://www.facebook.com/donna.blackgivens.75?__cft__[0]=AZbh-MnmtRecYnKI6wcn7_iI_CP2oapSthhlLsYUq-EKSMdebuao6MXTQJX1U-FNRI-X8_aH9w6EUtzKX4Wa4ltcmBCgdKXDdNX634iRVPxy-pXUfXnf-_2GsKAnJ0vT1AyiI72hxrehQ5pWPWVnjyfgCrIzS9yHRrmvUQqU1vL8bA&__tn__=-]K-R) posted a comment publicly that appears to have been intended as a private message. It was quickly deleted.

But screenshots are forever.

The comment laid out behind-the-scenes coordination about who was invited, who could attend, who would be allowed to speak, and who would not. It even referenced how “having friends in the right places” matters.
After deleting the comment, Donna returned to the post and told [Jeremiah Giles](https://www.facebook.com/jeremiahshanegiles?__cft__[0]=AZbh-MnmtRecYnKI6wcn7_iI_CP2oapSthhlLsYUq-EKSMdebuao6MXTQJX1U-FNRI-X8_aH9w6EUtzKX4Wa4ltcmBCgdKXDdNX634iRVPxy-pXUfXnf-_2GsKAnJ0vT1AyiI72hxrehQ5pWPWVnjyfgCrIzS9yHRrmvUQqU1vL8bA&__tn__=-]K-R), “See you there!”  🙄
I have held onto additional information for months. But I am getting closer to releasing what I have been holding.
Because this was personal for me.

Donna’s bill, HB51, did not just raise policy concerns. It threatened basic constitutional free speech rights for people across this state who dare to speak out against elected officials. Not lies. Not slander. Not defamation. The bill’s vague language around what constituted “harassment” stood to create a protected class of elected officials and chill the speech of The People.

Media coverage, including from [1819 News](https://www.facebook.com/1819news?__cft__[0]=AZbh-MnmtRecYnKI6wcn7_iI_CP2oapSthhlLsYUq-EKSMdebuao6MXTQJX1U-FNRI-X8_aH9w6EUtzKX4Wa4ltcmBCgdKXDdNX634iRVPxy-pXUfXnf-_2GsKAnJ0vT1AyiI72hxrehQ5pWPWVnjyfgCrIzS9yHRrmvUQqU1vL8bA&__tn__=-]K-R), allowed Donna to soften and re frame the bill after it died. They did not examine what it meant for her constituents. They let her control the narrative.
In her own words, Donna said shutting down voices was “the farthest thing from the truth.” And that may be the public version.
But what was said privately, and what exists on audio, tells a different story. And I think the public deserves to hear the real story and why I doubled down against the bill.

And when the public hears her words out loud, the intent behind HB51 will be much harder to deny.
This is not about party.
This is about power.
And accountability.
Always follow the receipts.
P.S. Someone tell Scott Boone to get his PR crisis team on this stat. 😬

Donna turned on Jeremiah Giles to support Haygood and tried and limited his ability to speak at the SUMMERDALE SUNRISE. Donna also turned on Billy Jo Underwood. Donna is confused by her lies and seems to be burning bridges while she is standing on the bridge.

Want to read a little backstory to corruption read these two blasts from the past.

If a candidate is managed by Scott Boone aka Catalyst then it should be an easy decision: DO NOT VOTE FOR THEM.
