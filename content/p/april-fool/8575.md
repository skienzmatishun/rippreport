 Yes.  Tell them how South Korea and Japan didn't screw up.  Tell them America used to send the help, not beg for it from Russia or whoever will give it.  Tell them the decisions of life or death that the medical workers will have to decide over and over because of lack of supplies.  Tell them that Italy is consistently ranked in the top 3 healthcare systems in the World.  Tell them that the United States is 30.  Tell them that Alabama is 4th to last for medical care.  Tell them that pro-life means more than unborn.  Tell them the United States has no guarantee of an infinite future and that we are living in the poorest part.  Tell them that there is no guarantee that the wealthy states will drop the ones they have been propping up when the going gets tough.  Tell them that doesn't mean Texas wants us.  Tell them how close we came to electing Moore and how he could be swept into power.  Tell them how no one will do business with us then.
