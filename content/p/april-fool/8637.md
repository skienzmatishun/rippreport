 The latest is that a shrimp merchant was patient zero.  They believe from a toilet.  Toilet zero.  Or is it crap zero? But who is to say that in the end, no pun intended, maybe it's possible that it was crap from crap covered bat soup.  They really do eat everything.  On a side note, the brown string thing that goes up the spine of a shrimp is shrimp poop.  A poop spine. Anyway, continue.
