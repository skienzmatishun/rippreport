 Ripp , 
Do you REALLY think people are going to imprison themselves for a whole month?
When they hear that 80% of COVID19 cases are mild, 15% will feel like thy have a mild flu and the remaining 5% will need care.   How soon will the masses ask why they don’t quarantine that 5%?
Don’t shoot me or say I am a mean person, I am just asking how long before the masses revolt against being imprisoned, uh I meant quarantined?
If everyone is quarantined then who is growing the food? 
I see that a developer still has his crew building houses in one of the new subdivisions.  But the real estate lobby had this labeled as essential.
