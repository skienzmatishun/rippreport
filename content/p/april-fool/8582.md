 Ok, where is it?

MSNBC, like Fox, is a gutted skeleton of what it was 15-20 years ago.  Anyone with sense knows they are just mouthpieces for those who own them and have nothing to do with journalism. I do have a guaranteed paycheck because I am in an industry not affected.  One that requires college degrees and additional schooling.  I did it on my own. Self taught and rare in this business. I spent 20 years well below the poverty line and took nor applied for any assistance.  I'm sorry you don't have that luxury.  Maybe you can pull yourself up by your bootstraps like I heard throughout the years.  I saw common sense go out the window and replaced by bean counters. So I worked my ass off to never work for one again. But keep going on those gut feelings. Keep saying your sources come from something you've never yourself looked into because your chosen TV station owner told you to.
