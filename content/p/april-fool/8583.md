 Tell you what WATCHER!  You worry about you and your family, God forbid you have one and we’ll take care of ours. Imprisoned, you say!  That’s for people like you who are only talking crap about this virus and not doing a thing about it. You are probably the asshole posting how bad our hospitals are. Well, there will be plenty of people taking care of the young or old, the sick or the well, the hungry or those who have plenty and those who are rich or poor!  All the while you are bitching about everything that you don’t agree during your daily self pity party!  Of course you are a pathetic little person that we will, naturally, have to take care of.  Who care about this or that. Shut up your pie hole and get out of the way. We’ll take care of “Everything”!  We always do!  Crawl back to your hole! STFU!!!
