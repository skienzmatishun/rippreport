 "Do you REALLY think people are going to imprison themselves for a whole month?" Alabama? Probably not. "and the remaining 5% will need care." If the current rate of deaths, around 2.1%, does not change when the hospitals get overwhelmed, we are heading for numbers significantly higher than the President has estimated.  He's been underplaying this pandemic from the beginning and only getting in the way.  If not for Pence, it would be 10x worse.  But he's totally not underplaying this time right?  Right?  The 100th time? Fool me once, shame on you, fool me 100 times, shame on me.  "How soon will the masses ask why they don’t quarantine that 5%?"  They did, and then they found out shortly after that you can't do that because people don't show symptoms for 14 days. "Don’t shoot me or say I am a mean person" Dumb, horrible person, blind, cult member, "pro-life".  Oh and mean.  "If everyone is quarantined then who is growing the food?" That essential thingy you mention two sentences later.  That. "I see that a developer still has his crew building houses in one of the new subdivisions. But the real estate lobby had this labeled as essential." Protecting the banks from imploding when the construction loans default would be my guess.  It's not going to work, the developers are just digging themselves deeper.
