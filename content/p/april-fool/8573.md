 Got a source on the 2 million?  CDC says "12,000 â€“ 61,000 deaths annually since 2010" And that's spread over many months.  Not with a peak only 2 months from the first known case.  Maybe if the President didn't acknowledge any consequences for over a month?  Maybe the President shouldn't have cut the CDC's budget and knowingly dissolved the pandemic prevention that, in the past, sent experts to the source of outbreaks.  Maybe then, we could have started making the tests like South Korea did very successfully resulting in no lockdown.  You didn't care about expert's opinions when protections were cut for costing money.  You didn't have the foresight to see that the money that cost pales in comparison to the damage done.  Maybe someone actively screwing up the "flattening the curve" shouldn't have an opinion about it failing.
