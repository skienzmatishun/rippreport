 We could at least expect people not to get on 10,000 person cruise ships.  They could stay home from the beach and not congregate and overwhelm the regions hospitals.  They could not do the complete opposite because they can't look into things because they are all too busy circle jerking on Facebook to actually go look for themselves.  Surely you are in the medical field and know what you are talking about. Surely you know the state of our health care system that has been privatized and slimmed down to make the highest profit.  Talk to a nurse?  Have you?
