The month of April starts out with a day for fools, APRIL FOOL’S DAY. In Alabama some citizens are participating a 100%, at the potential risk of others.

{{< socialpreview url="https://www.al.com/news/2020/03/when-will-people-in-south-alabama-take-coronavirus-seriously.html" >}}

Why?

Because Alabama is usually dead last in every health category, education and job opportunities.

This is supported by Alabama being first in the nation, when it comes to political corruption.

Some people in our area are convinced that the virus is a hoax designed to dethrone the President.

Others believe in a China conspiracy meant to destabilize the economy.

Others believe this is a flu virus and some will die but that is par.

All of these people have one thing in common. They do not believe in science.

Political corruption, the lack of leadership from the Governor and the general apathy that Alabama citizens seem to share may cost us all.

**Be Smart** not an **April Fool**.

Prepare yourself for what may be the most financially stressful time of your life. You have options and resources that will assist you through this period.

A covid-19 economic injury disaster loan for $10,000.00 is available through the Small Business Administration.

In Alabama the virus and politics are a lot alike. Either you educate yourself or you become an APRIL FOOL.
