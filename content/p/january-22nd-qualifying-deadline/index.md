58.6 Million infected in the USA with SARS-COV-2 with 834,321 deaths, 2,000 new cases in Baldwin County this week alone. The Omicron variant is rampant in Alabama with UAB projecting a long January for our health care workers.

And yes it's that time of year again Baldwin County, qualifying deadlines loom for the local and state offices of District Attorney, Sheriff, A Circuit Judge Place, 4 County Commission Seats, The Alabama Senate and Alabama State House are January 28, 2022. Murray "Bubba" Lawrence Jr has been in Holman Prison since his conviction for the 2003 murder of Brandon Hastings... the hitch is our current DA (Robert Wilters) was the Judge on the case and the current Sheriff (Huey Mack) was the lead investigator; needless to say there are obstacles (other than that obvious) related to this case.

The unpopular Mobile Bay Bridge project $2.1B will have some impacts as well. The MPO which is comprised of elected officials from County and City governments will have to defend this position to the voters. And just in time for his 5th term, the Baldwin County Commission again bends to the Sheriff's will and is spending $65M to build a new jail in Bay Minette.

And we give the Donald Trump/Maga Mo Brooks led January 6th attempt to usurp the good works of our government their due.
