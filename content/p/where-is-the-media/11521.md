 I remember not to many years ago, before the traffic and the wholesale corruption, and the crowded schools and jerk cops, Fairhope was a nice little place to live.  Back then we actually had a reporter who covered Fairhope politics weekly in the Press Register. I forget his name. We actually had two because fairhope also had a paper that covered politics and the city council. Now there is no coverage other than Ripp. The Rothchild bankers have bought out every large, noteworthy news and tv news organization on the planet. These are the people who have brought down Trump, and now control local news.
