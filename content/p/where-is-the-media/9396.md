 I agree.   Don’t change the pier.  By putting g a park out where the subdivisions are will bring a focal point to that apart of town and allow the residents out there to have a park too.   Don’t choke up the pier with more things that can be out elsewhere
People on the other side of Greeno and 181 need parks too
