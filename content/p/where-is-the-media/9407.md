 He is shady, not smart. This oped was nothing more than a political spin. His goal was to get everyone riled up with pitchforks (not hard to do in Fairhope) because he IS part of special interest groups. 

There's a reason why he was fired from the NY Times. He is not an honest man and people shouldn't fall for this catalyst crap.
