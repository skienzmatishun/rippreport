 Oh Jack4fh, put a sock in it.   Do you think we haven’t followed Catakyst since its beginnings in the late 70’s?   Do you think we don’t know about Stacy merging with two young politics such as Elliot and Haygood in the early 2000’s?   Haygood was a computer science major and brought with him a program that robo called people. Haygood wanted to get into real estate so he used local politics to get his projects passed.   Meanwhile the politicians using Catalyst had to swear allegiance to Catalyst
We watched this outfit turned over to Boone and it became Catalyst 
Yes Jack4fh, you assume that we know only what Ripp writes but we know more.
