 Which ones are Rothchild owned? I'm not familiar.  These are the billionaires who own the major media corps. I don't know why you singled out one family?  My guess is one of the billionaires below paid to influence you to believe that.  It keeps the heat off them.  Do you mean financial institutions? They don't care about Trump.
