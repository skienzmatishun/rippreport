 So, anyone who moves to Fairhope is tarred by your "where the hell were you" paintbrush?  If you haven't been a constant complainer you have no right to speak?  My family's been here over a hundred years and I am not a screeching banshee.  Does that mean I can't complain about a plan that was too vague to see clearly until the illustrated plan was released.  NOW I'm complaining.  The Bluff does not need to be turned into an ADA-compliant slope, losing our trees and elevated view in the process. Howell Raines is only calling a spade a spade - in his opinion.  Yes, you have yours, and he has his.  First Amendment, Dude.
