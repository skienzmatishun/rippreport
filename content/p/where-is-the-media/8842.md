 Jack4fh must be one of Catalystâ€™s shills
He comes to this site and makes a troll statement but when asked to state specifics he cowers and hides without giving an answer...
This is what worked for Catalyst in the past but is not working as it used to work.   As the voters become knowledgeable, Haygood gets on their bad list, Stacy now gone, Tucker out, some of their big candidates losing elections, and the fact that Baby Boone is running it it the ground will mean Cox will have to find somebody else to pay off
If Hightower loses, this will signal that Catalyst has reached its peak
