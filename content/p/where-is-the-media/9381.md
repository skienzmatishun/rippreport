 Look, I support Karin.  But I also think we need to leave the bluff and park alone.   Once they start tearing up that area, You can bet that cost over runs and government regulations will turn the whole concept into a disaster.  In the end we will have to pay entrance fees to cover the blunders 
I say leave the park as it is.  Just because someone gives you a big grant to do something doesnâ€™t mean you have to do it
Let them propose this to Daphne or better yet propose this to the west side of the Bay.  Did you all know Meyer Park wS a great park before USA fenced it off?   I say give that park to the people and leave our park alone!
