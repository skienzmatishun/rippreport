Don't let the Catalyst Good Ole Boy Club get you down!
Dont let the troll Jack4Fairhopia distract you!  
Remeber the Council know people read this site and probably ask, or even pay, people to respond back.

Hey Fairhope Council:  Why have you let things get so out of hand?
Why did you let our town get so overbuilt?  Oh, we know why.  It is because you were bought off by the developers!  You are either in development or you work at a bank that pays the developers.  You all need to be sent home this election.
