With the exit of Alabama Head Coach Nick Saban all Auburn alums are praying for a repeat of the Tubberville years on The Plains (not to be confused with the Tubberville years in the Senate, which no one will refer to as the good ole days). And within three days they have a new coach at "the university". Judge Wilters (currently serving as District Attorney for the 28th Judicial District) has answered the Rule 32 Petition filed by Murray "Bubba" Lawrence Jr wherein the DA claims that Brady Information withheld by the State of Alabama is not reversible error. It should be noted that Wilters was the Judge who sat on this very case. Reporter Brandon Moseley was in the Bass Pro Shop this week when a man swam naked in the fish tank, you get to hear it first hand. And also breaking the internet this week was a drunk Mountain Brook partygoer stuck in an urn during a cocktail party. This week a Federal Court dismissed Mobile Baykeepers lawsuit against Alabama Power Company related to the Coal Ash or CCRs that they intend to cap in place on the banks of the Mobile River. This week Brandon also gives us a preview of his latest article "The Top Ten Political Stories of 2024". And there could not have been a better weather day for the Martin Luther King Jr parade here in Daphne Alabama but this will not last... a big winter storm rolling in has cancelled schools in much of Alabama for tomorrow.
