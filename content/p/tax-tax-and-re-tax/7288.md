 Your comment is sad, but true.  Of course this guy is not a cop. A cop wouldn't say any of that. Well, not in public.  But so many of you just do not care about your community. You'll let it go to shambles because that's your source of income.  And you think taxing it will make it go away in one of the fastest growing parts of the country.

It's not surprising. You have been conned into believing that caring about your community is a liberal thing.  People like Rush Limbaugh, Hannity, Trump, Savage, etc.  They are rolling in their money laughing at you people.  And guess where they live? Oh, they say what a great place conservative areas are when they visit.  Then they go back to their homes in their liberal strongholds.  They wouldn't be caught dead buying property in places that they've pushed this mentality.  Hannity and Trump.  New Yorkers.  Savage? Oh he's got a house in San Fran, Beverly Hills, and West Palm Beach.

They wouldn't be caught dead buying property where the suckers who have taken in the con.  Why would they?  It's nobody's responsibility.  That other citizen, it's their duty!  Not me. Not the one wrecking the place with no proper planning.
