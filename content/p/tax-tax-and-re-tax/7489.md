 All registered voters within the boundaries of the special tax district, generally defined as the boundaries of the Fairhope Schools feeder pattern, including incorporated and unincorporated property, are eligible to vote for or against the future of our 5 Fairhope schools.  We all have the same vote, so equal representation is assured.
