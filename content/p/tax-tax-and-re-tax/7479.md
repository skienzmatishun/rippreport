 You folks in Baldwin County are rich.  You guys are like a honey pot for tax revenue for the rest of us here in Alabama.  When we need a new road in Blount County, your tax dollars will pay for it.  If the Medicaid needs propping up, the BP money from Baldwin will fix it.
But if you guys need a new bridge, then to hell with you.  Pay for it yourselves!
Yep,  you folks in Baldwin County don't keep up with what's going on.  You all are just a bunch of rich folks just needing to be taxed and governed.
