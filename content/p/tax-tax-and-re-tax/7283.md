 Whether or not he has a police report means nothing. A cop can arrest you for suspicion for spitting on the sidewalk.  
As one cop would say, "Just arrest them all and let the judge sort it out."
So, a police report is just that: a police report.  Today's police arrest first then ask questions later. 
Yes, it use to be "To protect and to serve."  Now it is "To harass, ticket, and arrest."  Is it any wonder why so many dislike the cops?
  With this type of thinking, anyone can have a police report.  I bet you may have one yourself.
