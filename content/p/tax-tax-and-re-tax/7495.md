 In 1935, a bridge across the Mississippi River in Jefferson Parish was opened. It carried two rail lines and four 9 foot lanes of traffic across the River. It became known as the Huey Long Bridge. Eighty years later, the State of Louisiana decided to spend 1.2 billion dollars to widen that eighty year old bridge. As far as I know, no tolls were ever considered. Thatâ€™s $1,200,000,000 to widen an eighty year old bridge. Perhaps the Louisiana DOT should be assigned the responsibility of procuring funds for the Mobile River Bridge.
