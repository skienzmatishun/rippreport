 The developers are adding houses and stressing the infrastructure.   I believe an impact fee would help but the developers fund and pay for the politicians via Catalyst to keep this from happening.  
One candidate last election said “Let growth pay for growth and the developers threw money at his rival to make sure impact fees would never happen 
Why should we old Baldwin Countians pay for the newly needed infrastructure caused by the developers when we have been paying for it all these years?
It is because impact fees take more money out of the subdivision builders’ pockets and it is far cheaper paying for politicians who will kill any impact fees
I know at least three commissioners are owned by Catalyst and Catalyst is a front for the developers 
In essence Catalyst is robbing Baldwin County as the satanic politicians say they are  Christian Conservatives
