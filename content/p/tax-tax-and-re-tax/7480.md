 How do you know when the property values will start to decrease?  Three ways:
1.When they start building cheap homes (Express Homes) on the back of the fancy subdivisions (like what they are doing on the back of Belaton) then you will know they have "jumped the shark" in that area.
2. When you see DR Horton jump ship and leave like rats jump a sinking ship, then it is time to leave.  But some developers will stay longer to build apartments, low income homes that will bring crime and drugs - like Express Homes.  See number three below:
3. When they start building apartments to further squeeze in more people, this place has peaked.

You may thank the lying politicians who said they were christian conservatives when in fact they were lying catalyst flunkies that were put in office by DR Horton, Cox, Prebble, Haygood, and the rest of the folks that moved in here to exploit and ruin.
