 Ripp reports the news that the old legacy media wonâ€™t report. The old media has journalists that are lazy and are so afraid of being laid off that all they do is report press releases and run Shoe Station ads.
So what part of this article that exposes the fact that we here in Baldwin have been snookered by new taxes imposed upon us by politicians who LIED to us?
I think this is something that needs reporting because the old media is too busy pushing Shoe Station ads that they no longer report anything of value
I heard that Ripp gets over 12,000 clicks per week.  It is because the people have no other news source and he fulfills this need.  It is Friday and I cannot wait for his Friday post.  I will click every 15 minutes until he posts his Friday post
