 I can tolerate politicians in Church because we all are sinners. I cannot tolerate all those politicians who lie and have sexually harassed  Women and also those politicians who have paid for their abortions. This is a crime not to mention the fact they want full control and are screwing us by raising taxes and deceiving us by leaving out Education out of the Lottery. Kay Ivy is a real disappointment to women’s rights. Has she ever gotten  pregnant by a rapist? NO politician should even have a vote on a Woman body decision, especially a group made up of mostly White terrible people.  This is another act that will cost Alabama tens of millions or more. As far as Jackass Jack Burrell wanting to get out of the school business. Tell him that’s okay, just pay us back all the past Airport money (millions) that the city has paid and discontinue the hundreds of thousands of dollars we pay each year to the Airport and he will change his mind in a New York second!  He’s out of here!  That’s a promise that will happen in any election he decides to run for my fellow Fairhopians.
