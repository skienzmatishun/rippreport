Baldwin County Sewer is the only, private, unregulated sewer utility in Alabama. The County commission has refused to tackle the issue of BCSS being unregulated. BCSS uses the county right of ways free and developments on farmland can use BCSS for subdivisions, which expands development sprawl. They have raised rates at will.

BCSS has been recently involved in several lawsuits that have involved land and business fraud, among other charges. One of the principals of the BCSS resides in Costa Rica, he is not interested in what is happening in Gulf Shores.

Baldwin County citizens should insist that BCSS be a regulated utility, until then you will just get the legal run around. PLEASE ATTEND THE MEETING OR WRITE IN YOUR COMMENTS

Consequently, ADEM scheduled a public hearing on the application this Thursday, May 19, at 6:30 p.m. at the Eric H. Meyer Civic Center located at 1930 W. 2nd St., Gulf Shores. ADEM representatives will also be available for two hours prior to the hearing — in the Gulf Shores Activity Center at 260 Clubhouse Drive — “to answer questions and provide details regarding the Baldwin County Sewer Services’ proposed permit modification.”

Baldwin County Sewer Services cannot be trusted, while UN-regulated.
