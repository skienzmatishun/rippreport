A new true crime news show (the third such national program to cover this story) will be premiering on the Oxygen Channel this Saturday night January 28, 2023 at 8PM recounting the political prosecution of former Mobile County Commissioner Stephen Nodine for murder in the "Bosom of Justice" aka Baldwin County, Alabama. You think you know about this case? Doubtful.
