Steve Nodine, former Mobile County commissioner, was indicted in 2010 for the suicide of Angel Downs, a case later revealed to be a fabricated homicide. Nodine claims the death was suicide, citing evidence including a 9mm gun fired once, found in her hand, and a spent 40-caliber round in her truck—mismatched and inconsistent with the 9mm. He asserts the prosecution’s timeline, including a beachday narrative involving a convenience store, golf course, and clothing change, is implausible and suspicious. Nodine, a 28-year public servant with no criminal record, was targeted due to his influence and exposure of figures like Herman Thomas and Deborah Mack. The prosecution, led by Judy Newcomb, David Whetstone, and Hallie Dixon, used false claims—blood on the truck, a nonexistent videotape, and staged medical testimony—to build a false case. Dr. James Downs (hired by Newcomb), Dr. Lawrence (who mimicked Angel’s hair flaring), and Dr. Eugene Hart—all confirmed the death as suicide. Hart’s testimony, later revealed, was suppressed; a consensus of three Alabama pathologists found the death was suicide. The prosecution’s use of outside experts, especially after cremation, and the refusal to share autopsy details, raises ethical and legal concerns. Whetstone, a former DA, pushed for special prosecutor status and later pursued the case, despite lacking law enforcement training. He and Hossmack falsely claimed a videotape existed, despite no footage. Grand juries operated secretly, with judges instructing jurors to pick one theory—violating reasonable doubt. Nodine’s plea deal was rescinded, and he offered to re-charge with murder if Whetstone would retry. Whetstone backed down, fearing a harsher sentence in Mobile County. The case reflects systemic corruption: prosecutors, judges, and officials—including Hossmack, Newcomb, and Whetstone—faced conflicts of interest, political pressure, and a culture of suppressing dissent. Evidence of political interference emerged when Hallie Dixon wrote to Luther Strange that if prosecution continues, Ballman County prosecutors would testify for the defense—never before reported. The case also involved a separate 922(g)(3) federal charge for unlawful firearm possession by a drug user, stemming from a 2009 incident with marijuana and a sheriff-issued gun. Nodine argues this charge is part of a pattern of malice and collusion, echoing the “Judge Grenade” case. Critics highlight the failure to disclose exculpatory evidence, the lack of accountability in the Bar, OPP, and judiciary, and the absence of oversight in grand jury proceedings. Nodine, once a respected public servant, was used as a political pawn, with officials exploiting his position to advance re-election efforts. Despite a lack of physical violence, the prosecution promoted a narrative of fear and conflict. Nodine maintains he never engaged in violence, calling the case a failure of integrity. He and attorneys Dennis Knisely and John Beck fought for truth, exposing misconduct. The case reveals a justice system where political influence, false testimony, and secrecy override due process. Final advice: if stopped by police, remain silent and get a lawyer immediately.
