 The voters of Baldwin county should be aware of the connections of Tucker Dorsey, candidate for place 3 on the Baldwin County Commission, to Clarence Burke and Baldwin County Sewer System. Dorsey and Burke are business partners in one or more corporations run by Burke. You will remember that in 2008, the Baldwin County Commission voted to give East Central Baldwin Water control over sewer in it's service area. This was strongly opposed by Clarence Burke and Baldwin County Sewer System. It appears that Mr. Burke is trying to get his man on county commission. Would this be like the fox guarding the hen house?

For those not aware, here is a bio Tucker gave to the Press Register: "A native of Atlanta, Dorsey graduated from the University of Georgia. He moved to Baldwin County 1994 and has worked locally in homebuilding and real estate, including managing a large residential development company, Magnolia River Management LLC, and assisting in building a regional wastewater system." 

The regional waste water treatment system is BCSS and both men are involved in Magnolia River Management LLC with Burke's Summit Const. Co. as the Registered Agent for the company.

There is an anti-incumbent bias with the voters this year but in this case the change could be worse that the incumbent.
