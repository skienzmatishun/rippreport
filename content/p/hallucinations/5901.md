 Lagniappe has tried to fill the vacuum of the Mobile Register going away and GCN being a shill for Catalyst. Lagniappe has done pretty good considering the load that was put on it.
I no longer read the Mobile Paper, aka Shoe Station Sampler, nor do I read GCN, also known as the Catalyst Courier.
Whatâ€™s more, Lagniappe is free and I donot have to pay for ads or stilted fake journalism
