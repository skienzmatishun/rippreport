 I was stunned at this award.  Gulf Coast News Today only ever covers one side of any story and that appears to the that of the City Council.  Also, GCN does not offer any ability to comment on these slanted stories.  Quite recently, it ran a story expressing the shock and dismay of the Council because Mayor Wilson had spoken in favor of Fresh Start Fairhope and rebuked her for using her position to inform voters.  Nowhere in the article did it mention that Robert Brown had, before this, written a strong message on his Facebook page "Robert Brown for our Hometown" disparaging the very idea of having a City Manager because, in his opinion, the current system is perfect.   Nothing from this Council nor from this "News"paper will surprise me again.
