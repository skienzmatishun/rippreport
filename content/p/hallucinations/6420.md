 First of all, my response was not for your remarks about Joe Faust. My feelings were not hurt by your post. You are entitled to your thoughts and perceptions. My Uncle Joe would be the one to address your concerns about his work history. He is a politician. He is aware that his choice comes with criticism. He does not expect me to respond for him. Call Joe and ask him.

It was the post that followed about my father, Bobby Faust that I was addressing. It isn't that it hurts feelings. It is more the absurdity. I spoke to Mr. Ripp on the phone about it a couple of years ago. I think the truth is just as important as you do but most people aren't interested in truth. They just want to believe whatever fuels the cause. I took the opportunity to say my dad isn't a jerk. He hasn't bought any Fairhope politicians. The only thing my dad along with other members of our family have done was attempt to protect the land they grew up on. That's it. No developments.
