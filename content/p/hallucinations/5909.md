 Not in Federal Court!  There will be an ending and Jack and the whole council will end up looking like they just fell in the sewer trap!  Can’t wait. All of you need to make sure if you are not already taking blood pressure meds to get some. If y’all stroke out! Dammit, that sounds good doesn’t it! I’ll wager one of you pricks do before it’s over. My money is on Boone and Burrell 2nd. Won’t be anything lost but a bunch of grumpy, dishonest assholes, who all get the prize for screwing up Fairhope everyday they breathe. Funk, hell you might stroke out just finding out the questions that these fools are going to have to answer under oath. Then comes me. Can’t wait!!!! It’s gonna be Sweet!!!!!!!!
