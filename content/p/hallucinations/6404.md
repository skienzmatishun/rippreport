 Not surprised that this kind of comment is allowed on this site. Really, Mr. Ripp?  You talked to me  about truth and fairness but you allow comments written anonymously by cowards to grace your pages. 
Bobby Faust is a private citizen and while "Aunt Pitypat" is allowed to say or think whatever he/she likes, is it really necessary to attack an 84 year old man's good name on the Internet? 
How about some facts about why you think he is a jerk or who you think he buys? Give us your name so we can see what a fine upstanding citizen you are? Bobby Faust is my father. He has never run for political office.I don't enjoy reading people's mean comments about him. Of course, I wonder who you are and what could possibly make you such a bitter, sad human being. Drop me a note or message me on Facebook if you want to discuss it like an adult. I can tell you whatever you want to know about my dad. I can also tell you he has never taken advantage of anyone. He and I don't share political parties or views but he raised me to respect people and their opinions no matter how much they differ from mine. 
Sincerely,
 Lorie Faust-Epstein
