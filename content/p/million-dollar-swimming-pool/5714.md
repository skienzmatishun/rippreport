 Let’s not forget that Boom Boom BP Oil Spill money thief Alabama State Senator Trip Pittman turned the $42,000 salary into over $900,000. Getting rid of Trip Pittman and now we have a chance to get rid of Baldwin County Commissioner Chris Elliott who is running for State Senate. Let get rid of all these sorryasses and throw in Tucker Dorsey and Michelle Thomason to boot. Make Baldwin County a better place. Vote the turds out. Get you butt in gear and go vote and make possibly the biggest and best decision you will ever make. Get rid of these Sob’s. Got to vote though. It’s your privilege and Duty!
