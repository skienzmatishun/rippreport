 The world laughs to the point of getting aches.   What a shame.  Baldwin County is turning into a suburban county full of people working 9 to 5 jobs, making mortgages, hanging out at restaurants on Friday nights, being at ball fields on Saturdays, food shopping on Sundays, and repeating the workweek through Friday
These were the same people who laughed at the yuppies 25 years ago.  Stupid hypocrites    Now they are being bsmboozled by a few politicians who will tax and overgovern them
