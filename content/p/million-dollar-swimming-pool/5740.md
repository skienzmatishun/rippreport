 Just look around and ask people who you think vote using common sense and who are good people. When you vote, take time to think about whether you want good things stripped away very quickly or make the right choices and ensure the right choices for you, you family and even you Grandchildren. Get out and Vote. These people don’t have to be just politicians, but others in different local, state and federal positions. WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE. GET OUT AND VOTE AND LOOK OUT FOR WHAT YOU AND YOUR FAMILIES DESERVE. This neighborhood pool crap is a tiny expample of how crooked these assholes are. Unfortunately, these people are self serving and by now, you know the scumbags that are and have been named. If you vote for DUI Chris Elliott, Tucker Dorsey or shitty Judge Michelle Thomason. You don’t know the or have taken the the time to see the lies and damage these people do every single DAY!!!!
