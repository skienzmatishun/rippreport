 Klaus is correct.  Baldwin County voted for Roy Moore, which proves that the voters here are either monumentally stupid or that they just all have their heads stuck in the sand and are too clueless to look around and see what is happening here.  The Ripp Report does an excellent job of trying to inform and educate but it reminds me of the old saying, "You can lead a man to learning but you can't make him think."
No wonder the world laughs at Alabama.
