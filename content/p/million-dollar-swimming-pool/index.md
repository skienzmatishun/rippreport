Catalyst players have developed a shell game called follow the LLC’s. Daphne Mayor, a catalyst charter member, explains that “Alabama is a buyer beware state.” BUYER BEWARE OF CATALYST is what consumers should be aware of.

IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO BUY A HOME IN BALDWIN COUNTY, THIS IS A MUST READ.

{{< socialpreview url="https://www.lagniappemobile.com/news/local/bellaton-residents-seek-resolution-of-pool-mortgage/article_fbb538c5-2d77-526d-9f1f-6f558f1a9d80.html" >}}

This is one of the best consumer beware articles I have read in quite a while and anyone looking to buy a home needs to read this several times, or you could be buying a million dollar pool.

IF YOU ARE A VOTER IN BALDWIN COUNTY THIS IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF WHY TO VOTE OUT TUCKER DORSEY AND CHRIS ELLIOTT, CATALYST REPRESENTATIVES.

Chris Elliott has raised almost 500,000 dollars for a State Senate Seat that pays 42,000 a year, in salary.

That is 12 times the amount of one year employment. Elliott has sold out to Montgomery, and every one else. If you do not see red flags flying around Elliott then you are color blind, or underwater.

The cast of characters in the million dollar pool are the same individuals that support Catalyst, Dorsey and Elliott.

One name not mentioned is John Avant, however he is in the deep end of the pool. Avant of Prebble-Rish is business partners, more convoluted LLC’s, of Kevin Boone, City Councilman in Fairhope.

Boone has Catalyst tattooed on his ass, and his son Scott,”baby” Boone is the Catalyst chieftain. Now guess who contributes to Catalyst and put Boone in office? John Avant and all the people in the pool.

“FOR SALE: BELLATON HOMES COME WITH A MILLION DOLLAR POOL

Prospective home buyers do your homework, read the facts and stay clear of Bellaton subdivision and D. R. Horton and CATALYST bellatonpoolfacts@gmail.com.

A vote for Elliott or Dorsey is a vote for Catalyst WARNING: STAY OUT OF THE POOL
