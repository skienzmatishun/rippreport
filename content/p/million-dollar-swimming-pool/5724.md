 Regarding Eddie Tyler. I hope he doesn’t think he’s safe with the contract he has with the Baldwin County School System. His ethical values have already put his contract into question. So go on Mr. Tyler. Push DUI Chris Elliott as much as you want to, but I suggest you get on Northcutt’s  side. He is for our kids and for our family. Not for what Montgomery wants us to do. Get rid of these Catalyst and quit pushing Elliott in the Teachers. They can decide for themselves.
