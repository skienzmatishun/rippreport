 Please EAGLE SCOUT:::: I understand that you want to say what you want to,  Even though we are in unfortunate times and have some Eagle Scouts tainting the honor of being an Eagle Scout. Don’t worry, there are sorry people like Phil Webb of Fairhope  who is probably the sorriest and the exact opposite of what a true Eagle Scout is supposed to represent. Let’s not use bad language even if you substitute some letters. Let’s be better than Phil Webb and those Eagles who truly didn’t earn their badge and have gotten several Adult Awards for ruining the good name of Scouts by lying and stealing and even threatening with deals to obtain these awards by also ruining the Mobile Area Council. Terrible “LOT” of folks.  Let’s show people that there are still Eagle Scouts and Scouts and Troop leaders that hold true to their word and that have Character and Honor!  We owe that to our fellow Scouts and volunteers that work hard to make us better people. Don’t forget, we have to be strong unfortunately the Eagle Scouts like Phil Webb who have been tainting what Scouts really stand for. He steals from his financial clients, if anyone should want to question which Phil Webb we are talking about  Clean up the language and not use Eagle Scout as your posting name please.  Thank you!
