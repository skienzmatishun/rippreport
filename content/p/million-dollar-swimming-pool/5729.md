 Don’t forget about Mike Box the School teacher in Mobile. Thank God we have some good Boy Scout Troops in BALDWIN County that are not affected by the likes of Phil Webb and Mike Box and the Board of Directors of the Mobile Area Council. They let the Catalyst in and basically bankrupted the Council. We don’t want the Catalyst ruin Baldwin County citizens too. As a Scout Master, I can assure you that Baldwin County Boy Scouts only have affiliation by name with the Mobile Council and not their practices. Way too many sorry Mobile Boy Scout Council Board Members are from Baldwin County and screwing up things for everyone. Phil Webb even threatened the Baldwin County United Way and the Girl Scouts of America by telling Board Members of United Way of Baldwin County that the “ONLY THING” the Girl Scouts are good for are for selling cookies. Is the United Way Board a Catalyst supporter also and do they allow such behavior from anyone, especially the board members of the Mobile Boy Scout Council. We don’t put up with that in Bay Minette for sure.
