 Nope Avanti,  I think not.   I wish you were right but the voters in Baldwin are not the same as they were in the 1990â€™s and before.   Most of these new voters have no roots in Baldwin County and see this place as just a stop on their career.  They will be bought off easy for their next ticket to their next stop.  I just wish they could see what they are ruining but why should they care?
