 I heard this morning that Karin is not seeking a third term. This will get her reelected.

Sherry is a catalyst person. She was mayor kants dalliance. High school diploma. Not what Fairhope needs at this juncture of time.

I think Karin will easily win now.
Catalyst should focus on 2024.
Karin's got this.

She has the momentum.
