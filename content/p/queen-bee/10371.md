 Fairhope voted this bunch back in and then voted in Sherry to top it all off.
So, Ripp, why do you think only a minority showed up to vote?  
You have to give CSB credit - they knew how to get their people to the polls.
I tip my hat to CSB.  With Corte's money, Cox's money, and the rest of the developers' money behind the politicians who use CSB, CSB is STILL a force to be reckoned with.
Lyn Stacy, Elliott, Haygood, and Scott Boone are indeed smart.  Well I know Stacy is deceased, but he leaves a legacy in Baldwin County politics.
