 Let me add that Sullivan, Pandora and Fidler were fired for insubordination. They were colluding with the council to obstruct the Mayor. The Mayor gave them the opportunity to get on board with the new administration, they decided not to accept the election results and to disrupt the operations of the city. They cooperated with the council to provide NO, absolutely NO information to Mayor Wilson about the previous administration projects, infrastructure, or going business.They deserved to be fired and they worked hard at being fired.
