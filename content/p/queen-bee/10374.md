 You are right CSB lost when Carl won  but I was surprised at the money involved. In the Mayor's race CSB depended on the Can't crowd and a popularity contest. The core group votes, they do not attend meetings and have not got a clear picture of Fairhope corruption. Developers, judges and attorneys all supported the Queen, now they have TOTAL control. I predict that this administration will see an indictment of an elected official. I say this because I know what they have gotten away with and they really feel as if Fairhope is THEIR town. The majority of voters stayed home and were asleep at the wheel, now they will see and pay.
