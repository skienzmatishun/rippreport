 So, show the proof!! I have read the reports from the investigation into Sullivan and Fidler(not sure of her spelling),and have not seen any proof of wrong doing on any part except Mayor Wilson's along with her own paranoia. She has ever admitted her wrong doing in an email. Ripp, why haven't you posted that? You say you are for the public, yet you are extremely biased. Why are you covering up for Mayor Wilson's wrong doing? Why have you not ever investigated the allegations against her? If you are truly against corruption then you should be investigating all sides. But as far as I can see, for the past 10 years the only corruption happening is when its something you don't like. You started really hammering away at the Fairhope city council when a new development (that I was not for) and fire station came to your neighbor hood. Funny how you never tell the honest truth about whomever you are endorsing. How about you answer some questions. How come the investigations you are so happy to post never involve the other side, probably because it would put you and them in a very bad light.
