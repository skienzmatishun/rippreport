 Well it is the morning after the election.  At this time we don’t know who the next US President will be but I am glad the the toll road failed.   I am happy for the residents of Barnwell and Rosington have been able to protect their homes from the predatory developers that have been licking their greasy teeth from Fairhope and Robertsdale
The city government’s intention Fairhope and Robertsdale have shown they are owned by the developers and should not be trusted with areas outside of their corrupt city limits
Take that, Catalyst!   Just because you buy elections in the towns still doesn’t mean you control ALL of the county
