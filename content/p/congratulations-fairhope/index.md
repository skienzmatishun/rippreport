After many years, countless meetings, most very boring, perseverance, and well written proposals, Fairhope will finally see serious BP money.

“After taking office, Mayor Wilson and Economic Director Sherry Botop submitted new proposals (different from those mayor Kant had submitted years earlier); the new proposals are what was just approved.”

Mayor Can’t proposals were not acceptable. Can’t had proposed at one time to buy the Triangle property to resolve a lawsuit that ultimately cost the city 11.25 million. The former Mayor also proposed to buy the land involved in the Breland case, in court now. He never mentioned the sewer infrastructure. The former Mayor was in la la land thinking BP dollars were in the mail. Can’t is history, just like his flaky proposals.

Fairhope is playing Russian Roulette in court and the city council has not said a word to the general public. The gun is cocked and aimed at the head of the Fairhope council, the absolute worst in 20…

Mayor Wilson, Economic Director, Sherry Botop and Fairhope staff worked hard and long, they deserve a pat on the back for securing 20 million in BP funds. This is a major accomplishment with 6.2 million going into a waterfront project, 10 million in sewer projects, that have been neglected for years, and $650,000 for an updated comprehensive land use plan.

With BP Restore Act money anticipated to flow into Fairhope during 2019 to the tune of almost $20 million, one project city leaders are particularly excited about costs less than $1 million. There’s $6.2 million for a waterfront, pier and park project and more than $10 million to solve sewer overflows polluting Mobile Bay during …

“Fairhope Planning Director Wayne Dyess said there will be plenty of opportunities for public participation as the city looks to define areas where growth would be most beneficial.

There will be numerous public meetings,” he said. “This will be a very, very heavy public engagement aspect of the planning effort.”

Public engagement and public participation are entirely different, let’s hope Fairhope citizens take this opportunity to be a part of Fairhope’s future and participate in the comprehensive plan.

These, approved, BP funds will be used in a manner the funds were intended. There has been plenty of abuse by corrupt politicians.

Of $1.15 million paid to Fairhope from BP grant funds overseen in part by state Sen. Trip Pittman for oil spill response work, the city awarded Pittmans company $639,000, according to city records reviewed by a Fairhope councilwoman.

Pittman is gone, with his money.

Let’s not forget the former Luv Gov and his beach mansion:

The boarded up, run down Governor's mansion on the beach in Fort Morgan has been an eyesore for years. Now, new life and new controversy as money from the 2010 oil spill is being used to pay for renovations.

Bentley is gone and was last seen in Las Vegas with his honey.

Then there is the Beach Hotel for those who can afford it.

The mansion was destroyed decades before the BP oil spill.

If all that corruption were not enough the State of Alabama sucked up millions more to pay for legislative bad management and neglect of the state medicaid deficit.

The Alabama House of Representatives may have found a budgetary hail mary in using settlement money from the BP oil spill to move the state closer to meeting the required commitment to Medicaid that’s challenged legislators for years. A joint federal and state program, Medicaid assists hundreds of thousands of low-income and disabled Alabamians with …

CONGRATULATIONS, again, Mayor Wilson, Economic Director Sherry Botop, Fairhope Planning Director Wayne Dyess and all the staff who worked on the BP proposals that yielded the city 20 million dollars. These approved projects are what BP money was designated for.
