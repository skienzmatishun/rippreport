 This court order is only a delay in the process.  The people wanting these apartments in are determined to get these in.  Watch them change the drainage and be right back to work.
But I will say this:  Paul Francis Ripp, I am proud of you in your relentless work in bringing to light the crooked council.  This council is definitely in Corte's pocket and you keep proving the crookedness of the council.  I cannot wait to see these bums get voted out.
