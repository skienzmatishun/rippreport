 I guess this let’s all the Current City Commissioners off the hook after the swore to us before God that the would vote against the Fly Creek Project if elected??? Wrong!!! Y’all still are the same sorryass lying son of bitches that you were when running for a Fairhope City Commissioner spot. One thing the Ripp Report had shown me is that which candidates campaigned on the fact if they were elected that they would vote no in the Fly Creek Project. No matter if it passed or not. You all are which of liars no matter if this is stopped or not. The people will remember that all you lied even before being elected. That’s how stupid some of our citizens are. I do have a feeling that they are getting smarter though!!!
