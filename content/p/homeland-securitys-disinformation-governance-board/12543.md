 The baby boomers destroyed this country 
They we’re spiked in the 1950’s, rioted in the 1970’s, sold the country’s future in the 1980’s, then when they found out they were growing g old in the 1990’s they wanted respect from the younger generations.
The boomers know that their day is coming and they will pay for the filth they inflicted on the USA
I, a Generation Alpha person who is aware of what the boomers did, will make sure that no respect and all contempt will be granted to the boomers.   We have nothing to lose because you sold us out boomers
