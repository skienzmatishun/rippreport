 Russia has banned all media from calling the war a war.  They have blocked Facebook.  Twitter is a company, not a government org and there is no law telling Twitter what to do as, there shouldn't be. Twitter went downhill starting the day it went public. I don't believe that Twitter can take steps to stay relevant with shareholders. I'm not an Elon fanboy but if someone is going to do it, he's the right fit.


You have alternatives.  None of which are blocked and no one is being arrested for their speech.


Social media will be changing in the next few years with new decentralized tech and concepts coming out soon.  The new stuff won't be able to be censored or blocked/removed. I don't think you're going to end up liking the result.
