In 2017, Jennifer Fidler and Sherry Sullivan were both fired from their longtime Fairhope city posts by then-Mayor Karen Wilson.

The move stunned Fairhope leaders, enraged the then-City Council and sparked a petition to have Wilson removed from office.

Five years later, Fidler and Sullivan could soon be two of the city’s top policy makers.

Fidler and Sullivan are CATALYST true bloods. They made Mayor Wilson’s life hell and tried to upend anything the newly elected Mayor and her staff proposed. The council aided and abetted Sullivan and Fidler. Councilman Kevin Boone, father and chief informer for his son Catalyst figure head, Kevin Boone and Jack Burrell publicly bullied Mayor Wilson at city council meetings.

CATALYST is the developers political party. It is a cancer that has keep Baldwin County corrupt and until it is defeated corruption will flourish. The name CATALYST became so toxic that they changed the name to Scott Boone Consulting. That is all that changed, they are still a bunch of small minded, extremely selfish people, that will do anything to maintain control over the status quo.

As soon as Sullivan was elected she was rewarded for her bad behavior. The council gave Mayor Sullivan a raise and then gave her a second check as head of utilities. Double dipping is common in corrupt municipalities and Fairhope has a history of being corrupt. How in the hell anyone thinks double paychecks from your city or county is ethically correct, is beyond many citizens comprehension.

Elect Fidler for Representative or Johnathan Armstrong as county administrator, the county double dipper, or Steve Carey, Tucker Dorsey and Catalyst’s candidate, and you are voting against your best interest and quality of life.

Faust has long been CATALYST favorite son. However CATALYST will eat their own, if it furthers their control over Baldwin County politics. FAUST is the better choice.

PLEASE VOTE FOR JOE FAUST DISTRICT 94
