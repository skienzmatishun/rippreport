 Oh please stop the “REMFRANT” term.
Can’t any of you Catalyst mouthpieces come up with specifics.  I know I have asked this before and am asking again
This is because you have NEVER answered with specifics
You repeatedly run back to your hiding place
Go to Chuckie and ask him to give you some more name tags
Chuckie did a good job with names when he wrote the Catalyst Pravda Piece know. As the Baldwin Insider.
Oh by the way for you Catalysts in Spanish Fort: Pravda was the communist propaganda paper.
