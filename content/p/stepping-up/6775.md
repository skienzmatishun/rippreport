 Hey Ripp?  When you talk about a State senator screwing is out of so much BP boom money. Please do not forget to mention the fact that it was no other than Past Alabama State Senator Trip Pittman. We want to make sure that Trip get the credit. After he ran for The U. S. Senate and barley got 7% of the votes. We donâ€™t want anybody to get ole sorryass Trip Pittman mixed up with anyone else. Put his name in there next time. Are you going easy on thieves too!
