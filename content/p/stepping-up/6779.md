 Baldwin voters deserve what they voted for.  So many people have moved here from areas that have high taxes.  They say “People up north pay five times the taxes we pay.”
I say, “That is THEIR problem.”
If you want to pay more taxes go cut a check with your own money and give it to the government.  However, don’t mske the rest of us do it.   Absolve your own conscience - not ours.   I don’t have a vague feeling of guilt for what I have earned.
