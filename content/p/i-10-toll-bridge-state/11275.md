 So what are you going to do about it?  I say we need to tell the road people that EITHER YOU OR YOUR SUCCESSORS WILL FIND A WAY TO BUILD A BRIDGE WITHOUT TOLLS.
If they cannot then we need to find people who will and have the Legislature replace them or we will replace the Legislature as well.  
But the people in Baldwin are too busy working overtime paying for their overpriced houses built by the future ghetto builders.  Yes, DR Horton, Truland, and Bellaton, this means YOU.  You all might own every politician here but you don't own all of us!
