 I think making truckers pay a toll will only raise the prices of goods the consumers buy. I feel if we need a toll let the out of state people who come through our I-10 pay it. Not the taxpayers of Baldwin, Mobile County, and the citizens of Alabama. We need to lower the grocery tax in Alabama (easy fix), need to put career correction people on the parole board not friends, need to replace all the leaders over the prison system, need to educated the inmates in prison so they can make it in the free world, need to not charge military workers State tax when going to training in other states on their checks. Other states don't charge them. Need to have term limits for people. Need to let the taxpayers of Alabama vote on a lottery and gambling not Montgomery.  I am not for it but that would be fair. What I am trying to say WE NEED TO CARE ABOUT EACH!!!!!! We all have issues... I want to make Alabama the BEST IT CAN BE.
