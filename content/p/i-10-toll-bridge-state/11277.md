 What will the developers do when the toll adds to the cost of living in Baldwin and commuting to Mobile?  The developers make sure no impact fees are charged when they throw up their balsa wood houses, overcharge for them, and give the subdivision a corny name,  so I am sure that they will do something to mitigate the tolls.
