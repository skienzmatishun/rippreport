 I remember that one time the old Causeway once had a toll.  The state promised that when the bonds were paid off, the toll would go away.  Back then they kept their promise.
Back in the 1970's and 1980's the Wallace Tunnels were power washed almost every night and kept clean and pristine.  Now, they are dirty because the tunnels are not being cleaned as often.  Why not?  The state will tell you to save money.  The state will hire a six figure bureaucrat and then take the money from cleaning to pay his or her expense.  What a shame.
If the I10 bridge gets a toll on it, then all the commuters who moved over here and did not pay attention to the politics deserve to pay the toll everyday.  They let the Catalyst-owned developer-politicians get into office and do this to Baldwin County.
People in Baldwin County are a buch of people just waiting to be governed and taxed.  Baldwin County has become a honey pot for the rest of the state.  
"Tax the heck out of Baldwin County and spread it around the state."
I don't have to drive to Mobile because I head east to Pensacola.
HA HA HA HA   Take that you stupid voters!!!!!
