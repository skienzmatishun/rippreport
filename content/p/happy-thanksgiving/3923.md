 I have to question this statement.   Catalyst is alive and well.   With its indirect mouthpiece called “The. Baldwin Insider” it is living.    Even though.  Catalyst has exiled Tripp Pitman and  Chris Elliot,  it still runs the campaigns of the county politicians.    Begin looking at the campaign reports of politicians when they file them this upcoming election.   I won’t be surprised if  Boone and Stacey changes Catalyst’s name again to throw off the voters because it was once called “Elliott, Haygood, and Stacey.”
As long as there is money to be made then Catalyst will exist in one form or another as it has since the 1970’s.
