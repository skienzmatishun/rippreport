 We hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal. That they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights that among these rights are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness 
THAT TO ENSURE THESE RIGHTS GOVERNMENTS ARE INSTITUTED AMONG MEN DERIVING TGEIR POWER BY THE SELF GOVERNED
This means that freedom comes from God and not the government.  Government does NOT grant us rights.  They were already ours.  Donâ€™t let the politicians try to tell you otherwise
