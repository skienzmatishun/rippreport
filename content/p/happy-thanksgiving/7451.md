 Too bad many folks donâ€™t get this simple fact
To the people reading this and went to Mobile County Schools: please know that the Constitution and Declaration are two different documents
The Declaration of Independence was  ratified in 1776 and the Constitution in 1789.
Also to Mobile County School system graduates please know that a war had to be fought AFTER the ratification of the Declaration of Independence
