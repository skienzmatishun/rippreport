 Why is fascism connected to "RIGHT WING?"
Maybe Harry Still, candidate for Attorney General of Alabama (Has my vote) can add to this?

The left wants more government

They actively censor the conservatives

They want high taxes

They support government mandates but defund police?

For open borders and abortions..and government sponsored HC.. hmmm

Trudeau is being very authoritarian...and he is a leftist

Fascism...can be left or right...? Right?

But the left to me seems most comfortable with trusting big daddy government...in total control.

"Use military to stop Trucker protest"

What thinks you, Sir?
