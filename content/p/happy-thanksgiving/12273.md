 I hate Trump more than anyone I know to the point it affects my physical health and has for a long time. I'm on a daily anti-anxiety ( Busprirone) and as needed panic attack drugs (Klonopin). Each day I see the scum going unpunished deepens my dark mood and suffering. I am losing hope that he will ever be brought to justice. How do I give up my obsession with him?

For me, the time before the election and Biden taking office was bad. I only have occasional bouts of anxiety and depression that I deal with by seeing a therapist, and that was why I first saw her. That and generally not feeling so great because of the COVID isolation. I have been bringing up how I'm dealing with a little extra bad feeling because of the overall political climate lately. It just helps to talk about it.
