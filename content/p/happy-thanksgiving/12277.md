 Mo Brooks is running again. The Lincoln Project (Known Pedophiles look it up) are after Mo. They were after him last time he ran.  Mo is running against the former worker of Senator Shelby, she got coffee and juice for him when he needed it.  He will control her if she is elected. She has billboards from Baldwin to Bham and it is disgusting. She is the globalist candidate.  A war veteran is also running.  Some special forces fellow. He may get a few votes.  But this race is important for Alabama. We need some fresh ideas.  I think Mo will get it in the end.
