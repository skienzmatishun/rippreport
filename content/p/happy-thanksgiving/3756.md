 I agree with Alpharetta.....I am thankful for everyone who helps to expose the corruption of our political leaders and the greed of those who support them.  My wish is that anyone on our City Council might vote his conscience for a change, rather than in support of a Council President that he fears.  Could CC votes be on paper????
