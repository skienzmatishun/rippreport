 Yep, I told you she would join the club! She listened to her advisors in the beginning and it appears she may have realized she was indeed getting real bad advice. Time will tell if a zebra can change its stripes. 

Now the budget is done, she really doesn't need the council for much, she now has the money to spend. Next budget cycle, if she doesn't get what she wants, then we'll see if those zebra stripes come back!

Politics, if you can beat them, you join them! Love it!
