 The KR case didn't require analysis or critical thinking.  Literally, you had to watch a 1 minute clip of what everyone was arguing over.  It was clear.  It was always clear.  People still argue because they will take the word of some TV channel over their own eyes.   But these days, you can have thousands of videos of people storming the capitol, and for millions of people, that's just too much to ask.  Short documents with proof? Should I read it? Nah what does the TV tell me.

The media sold us the war. No surprise that they would bury it.  But Biden is less responsible than all past involved presidents.  Most of the Afghan army didn't exist off paper for years.

If the system allowed for the income gap expansion, what is your solution?  Tax the rich? Stop bailing out failing business models?  Raise the minimum wage? Businesses that don't pay enough to keep their workers off welfare should no longer be able to exploit our tax dollars.  Supply chain issues?  Regulation?  

Quick google search, the following have reported Biden's low approval:

CNN, Bloomberg, The Hill, Newsweek, Fox News, NYT, Washington Post, Marketwatch, New York Post.  I'll stop there. Where ever you heard that, they lied to you.  They knew they lied to you.  And they lied to you.  And you'll go back.
