Memorial Day is an American holiday, observed on the last Monday of May, honoring the men and women who died while serving in the U.S. military.

They died so you could live with rights afforded to you by the Constitution of the United States.

While I was in Vietnam in the Marines my cousin was in the Army, 101st Airborne, located 50 miles south of my base. He was killed April 6th 1968, 50 years ago, his loss has had an impact on my extended family ever since. He has never faded from our memory.

In Memory of: Fred "Freddie" Johnson

He made the ultimate sacrifice for US.

Take a moment today and realize this is Memorial Day. Men and women gave their lives for your Freedom and Constitutional Rights.

GOD BLESS AMERICA
