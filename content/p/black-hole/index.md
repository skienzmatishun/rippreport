Alabamians have got to stop looking right and left, voting a straight party ticket, and putting party before country and that means Republican and Democrat. What is good for your state and community should come before party. Why vote for someone who will divide us? Why vote for someone so different in beliefs and convictions that there is not one Senator or Congressman remotely close to his thinking?

## Roy Moore tried to fit in with Senate Republicans for a day. It didn’t work. - The Washington Post

Roy Moore arrived in the Capitol to play an unfamiliar role: Republican conformist. By the time he left, he was once again a lightning rod for controversy.

Alabama has two US Senators, Richard Shelby who will die in office before retiring and in the interim is more interested in naming buildings after himself than doing anything substantive. The second Senator will be Moore or Jones, if it ends up being Moore, Alabama will be the equivalent of a black hole.

Mr Moore went to Washington last week and it was not pretty. He was shunned by most of his own party and was on the run from the media from the time he stepped into the swamp.

## Roy Moore’s disruption of Washington has already begun, and more is on the way - The Washington Post

Roy Moore didn’t travel to Washington on Wednesday to kiss and make up with the Republican leaders who opposed his nomination to fill the Senate seat formerly held by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. He came to continue the revolt.

Mr Moore will not debate his opponent nor will he accept the challenge to defend his views. He does expect people to vote for him without doing either. You should never vote for ANYONE of any party that is not willing to publicly defend his positions and outline what his constituents may expect of him if elected.

Speaking at a Tuscaloosa Christian school on Wednesday, the Republican Senate candidate said he's been 'mischaracterized' as hating gays.
