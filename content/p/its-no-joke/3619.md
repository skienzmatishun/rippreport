 If you don't believe that Alabama will suffer for electing Moore, remember what happened to North Carolina after that ridiculous 'bathroom bill' debacle.  I wouldn't be surprised if we lose Mercedes &amp; the other auto manufacturers we have, just to mention a few.
  No one likes a bigot, and there is an ocean of difference between common sense and a so-called liberal viewpoint.  Additionally, the Constitution calls for s complete separation of Church &amp; State to protect the people from government employees like Moore.  Our Country was not founded on any particular religion and those who engineered the Constitution did not consider themselves Christians at all.
