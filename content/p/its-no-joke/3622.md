 I do remember what happened in North Carolina....as far as loosing any automobile manufacturers I think you need to take a deep breath. Cause that’s NOT going to happen. As a matter of fact we will probably land a few more automakers. 
And as far a who is or who isn’t a BIGOT I think if you want to see one...go look in the mirror!
Don’t drown in your ocean of so called  liberal viewpoints. 
Moore is the better of the choice we have. 
Like I said Senator Moore will not be your senator if you move away from here. 
ADIOS
