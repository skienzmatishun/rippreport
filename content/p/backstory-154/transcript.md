# Transcript

The WHO ended the global COVID-19 emergency in May 2023, but the virus remains active, claiming one life every three minutes, continuing to mutate and cause long-term health effects. Travel mandates for non-U.S. land or ferry travelers were lifted, marking a major policy shift. Title 42, used to expel migrants citing public health concerns, led to over 2.7 million expulsions without proper asylum processes; critics deem the health justification politically motivated, part of Trump-era immigration restrictions. Biden maintained the policy amid record border arrests, though it has since ended. The migrant crisis reflects global patterns of flight from persecution, with absurdities like illegal immigrants dominating Chinese buffet lines highlighted.  

In Ukraine, Russia accused Kyiv of a drone attack on the Kremlin, widely seen as disinformation; in response, Russia launched air raids on Kyiv, Zaporizhia, and Odessa, all intercepted. U.S. and Belgian forces ramped up ammunition production, echoing Vietnam-era surges. During the Vietnam War, a Tuscaloosa box company expanded to three factories and 100 workers producing military ammunition.  

Jeffrey Epstein’s 2014 private calendar lists meetings with CIA director William Burns, Bard College president Leon Potstein, and Obama counsel Katherine Rumler—all after his 2008 conviction. Harvard’s Martin Nowak, a major donor, is among those linked, illustrating how wealth sustains elite access. The host questions how Burns, now CIA director, could meet Epstein repeatedly without suspicion, calling it implausible and alarming.  

Concerns grow over AI replacing human labor; the U.S. Navy plans to replace most carrier fighter jets with AI-powered, unmanned aircraft within a decade. In New York, a former Marine, Juan Alberto Vasquez, allegedly threatened subway riders with “I want food,” prompting a 15-minute chokehold by three riders despite open doors and a stopped train. EMS could not revive him; critics call the incident vigilantism and a civil rights violation. Over 100 P320 pistol incidents reported, 80 injured—Consumer Reports urges users to check CIG settings.  

In Alabama, the Retirement Systems’ six-lot subdivision plan was denied by the Planning Commission for years, dubbed “the troughs.” A proposed county-wide chairman in Baldwin County, to be paid heavily and controlled by the sheriff, faces criticism as a power grab. The state’s executive claims privilege over emails with the transportation director. Orange Beach caught a 600-pound bluefin tuna; a judge released defendants from a long-running Lake Forest defamation suit. A $2M deal nears between Sheriff’s Office and female jailers in Mobile.  

Gulf Shore students earn scuba certification, progressing from pool to freshwater springs to saltwater dives in Panama or Belize—now 10x safer than in the 1970s. Political transparency remains low in Fairhope; the governor’s $400 resident check was slashed from $400 to $105, with costs ballooning from $97M to $275M, adding $5M in extra expenses.  

A proposed $30M state health school in Maringo County was rejected by the Senate for lack of planning; a separate push to relocate it to Livingston faces opposition. Horace Mann admired the Prussian education model in 1843, which became mandatory nationwide, though lacking a standardized curriculum. John D. Rockefeller saw this as a chance to control labor by shaping education for industrial needs.  

Alabama’s Representative Matt Simpson introduced a fentanyl trafficking bill where dealers laid fentanyl on $100 bills during raids—officers reportedly got sick as fentanyl can cross skin. Simpson also proposed a bill protecting first responders exposed to fentanyl, treating exposure as a felony. A case in Mulligan County involved a suspect carrying fentanyl in candy-colored pills, likely targeting minors. A separate bill expands abuse order protections to include grandparents, grandchildren, and step-parents, with a 24-hour cooling-off period for repeat offenders.  

The University of Alabama fired its baseball coach after evidence—including cell phone recordings and emails—showed gambling contacts with a gambler. The coach, unaware of the fallout, was scheduled to speak at a nonprofit fundraiser in Oxford. Tucker, who was fired from Fox, traveled to Alabama and spoke at the event, praising Biden’s White House speech. Robert Kennedy Jr. saw a 20% Democratic surge despite skepticism over vaccine claims. A Trump comment on a rape case was cut from record; he moved into Trump Tower in 1984, one year after completion.  

Trump denied meeting E. Jean Carroll at Bergdorf Goodman, calling her a “whack jab” and claiming no personal knowledge. He denied the incident ever happened, calling it a “complete con job” and “fake story,” citing a June 24, 2019, statement to The Hill where he said, “She’s not my type.” He claimed to have seen a black-and-white photo at a charity event, recognizing John Johnson and Marla (then-wife), but had no prior knowledge of Carroll. He admitted not knowing her political party or any political links. On TrueSocial, he asserted the incident never occurred and was a hoax, criticizing the legal system as “broken.” He used “swoon” as a euphemism for sexual intercourse, denying the claim of rape or “swooning,” and called the narrative a fabrication. He dismissed allegations from Natasha Stoynoff and Jessica Leeds as false, asserting that if misconduct occurred, it would have been reported with exact dates. He claimed the world should know the truth and accused E.G. Carroll and her attorneys of false accusations. The episode ends with a casual farewell and a suggestion to revisit prior content.
