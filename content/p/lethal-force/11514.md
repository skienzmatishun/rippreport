 Paul, I got excited when I saw your "License to Steal" report only to be disappointed the AG is not living up to his campaign promises.

I am now in my 2nd year of monthly payments to the Baldwin Co court system because of the corruption between them and the audit division. Quick reminder but they got me on a sales tax issue that did not apply to my event based biz which had no durable exchange of goods.
 
This warrants an investigation as they have been described by other lawyers as being a racket &amp; predatory on the poor citizens of our county that could not afford an attorney in court. I am disabled, 68 &amp; living on $850 a month social security &amp; have to pay Baldwin Co. 10% of that.

I thought Lagniappe was going to help me pursue this, but so far they have not. Please keep me in mind if anything you come across sounds familiar to my case to warrant pursuit of an investigation.
