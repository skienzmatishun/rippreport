 Corruption Cover up no evidence was held Other than her purse and cell phone the camper where she was stabbed at was never taken For the forensic team to go through it. Still cannot get an autopsy report. If Luther strange would have checjed into the case when we asked,, this would not be the way it is today ... I ask that our Attorney General as of 2021 ALONG with our Governor as of 2021 at least check in to the possibility of the cover up of the young woman's murder..
