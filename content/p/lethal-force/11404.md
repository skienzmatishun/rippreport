 Knowing all this is the reason I haven’t contacted the bar association to file any complaints, to do so would bring me more trouble and would cause them to admit to conflicts of interest on the benches and in the law offices and the school board office. I’m middle age and am waiting to see if the swamps are ever drained, reading your reports and articles let me know I was not wrong in assuming how deep it is in our state. I had to quit fighting certain “fronts” but I still send letters and sign my name on a variety of issues.
