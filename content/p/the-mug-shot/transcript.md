# Transcript

Harry Steele challenges disputed elections, citing cases involving Hillary Clinton and Stacey Abrams, calling current interference a "travesty of justice" and noting three such incidents. He asserts his views stand without needing a seconder, mocking the need for consensus. In a separate thread, the host reflects on a controversial Tucker Carlson segment, describing it as a satirical, sexually charged "puff piece" where Carlson "pulls Trump’s trousers down and services him on Twitter"—a comedic exaggeration the host calls absurd amid mounting legal scrutiny. Iowa polls show DeSantis closing the gap on Trump after the first Republican debate, with Brandon Ramaswami’s unique campaign gaining traction, especially among Republican allies. Ramaswami, a first-time, non-political candidate and first Hindu presidential nominee, faces skepticism over feasibility. Army Gen. Marshall requests investigation into President Biden’s relocation of U.S. Space Command to Colorado Springs, prompting lawmakers including Katie Britt, Dale Strong, Mike Rogers, and Jerry Carl to insist the review isn’t over—though the situation appears to be winding down. The move, described as politically strategic, may have been made pre-2024 to secure Colorado. Meanwhile, the Alabama Ethics Commission flags a minor police violation; a Huntsville city councilman pleads guilty to two counts of shoplifting, dismissed as a misdemeanor with no consequences. In Auburn, Alabama, Walker Cole Barkley’s wife, Nicole, contacted police after spotting a pistol in his drunk pocket—she feared he’d harm himself, not the children. Decatur police intervened; the case was reported to Paul in early August. A prior incident in July 2021 saw Barkley, legally barred from gun possession, take one from his wife and threaten her and the children. Officers responded to a 911 call where children were crying; Barkley pointed a gun at an officer, who shot him in the abdomen; Barkley returned fire, missing all five shots. The jury found him guilty of attempted murder of an officer, sentenced to 35 years—costing over $500,000 annually—drawing criticism for harshness despite lack of sympathy in prosecution. The prosecution highlighted the pistol in his pocket and his drunken state, though the charge is deemed "way overboard" by the host, who believes an appeal is likely. The wife claims she was denied visitation to Barkley in ICU, a claim later corrected by the DA’s officer. A new Omicron variant, B.A.2.86, emerges as the most mutated strain, fueling fears of widespread reinfections. Foley resident Jack Green criticizes the city council over explicit children’s library books, arguing sex education must be taught. A Bowen County woman launches a Moms for Liberty chapter to advocate parental rights in education. A mother and daughter from Fort Payne face murder charges after allegedly pushing a woman off a cliff, raising concerns about copycat behavior and the phrase “the family that kills together stays together.” In Colorado, an American tourist is allegedly propositioned, leading to a shooting. An officer fires through a Jeep’s windshield, wounding a female passenger; another bullet narrowly misses her. The suspect is unarmed and no longer a threat. Nick and Brandon remove a volatile volunteer from the car, highlighting the difficulty of managing mental health crises. The Alabama Medical Cannabis Commission violates the Open Meeting Act by holding an executive session without public disclosure; Brandon claims the meeting was improperly conducted to rig license awards—only five integrated facility licenses exist. Verona had a license now under legal challenge after alleged denial. Temperatures reach 110 degrees; Gulf of Mexico surface hits 90—near bathwater. A tropical depression moves from Cuba toward Florida, threatening Mobile and Pensacola; experts warn record-hot water may trigger a severe hurricane season, though it may still be mild. The state Supreme Court green-lights the Baldwin County Bridge project, allowing construction to resume—offering a crucial evacuation route for barrier island residents, especially if the Mobile tunnel remains closed during emergencies. A beaver dam in Foley holds a hot tub from Hurricane Sally; officials plan to remove it with a track hoe or dynamite, joking about sending the "Taj Mahal" into the bay with a flaming arrow. The next meetup is scheduled for America’s Untold Stories on Labor Day weekend at 93.1 FM in Montgomery, with Brandon urging sponsorship sales. A standalone podcast on the Murray Lawrence case is coming within a week. Listeners are reminded to stay updated on medical marijuana and the beaver dam, and to stay cool, avoid the heat, and enjoy the weekend.
