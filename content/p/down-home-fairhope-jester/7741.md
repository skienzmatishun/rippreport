 Ripp asked if I would post, since I am obviously not the person who posted using profanity below. My best guess is that it was Jester,the incorrigible clown from your hometown.

How much longer will the Fairhope citizens allow these five miscreants to ruin the city's quality of life?

This is a reasonable question.

Fairhope was once the golden goose.

Corruption-fueled overdevelopment killed its lofty status as a favored retirement destination.

The golden goose has been cooked.

Ripp will retire from his public service after the next election cycle and I know he too plans to eventually move on. It is inevitable, and many of you will follow, as the invisible foot rules the public market. People move to suit their interests.

What will be left in Fairhope is anyone's guess--but it won't ever be what it once was in terms of livablity. The tipping point has been reached.

It is regrettable; and it is the unshakeable legacy of the catalyst council.
