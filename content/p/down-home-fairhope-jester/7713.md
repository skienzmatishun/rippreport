 Fairhope is filthy with its corrupt politicians who are owned by the developers and bought at wholesale by Catalyst, which is financed by Cox and Prebble.
What is worse, when the Council voted against the people the other night, they did not even flinch.  This shows just how out of touch they have become and ewhy they must be voted out of office.
The voters are being made aware of this.  Watch Catalyst change its name.  But it will not matter - just pay attention to the financial reports.
