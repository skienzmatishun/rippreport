 Jack said public input sometimes political and would have been political...look at video from last council meeting.
Public input solicited only when city deems in their favor like rigged, no controls visual preference survey or purchase of k1 center...wonder who will be awarded contract on whatever is done there?
Greeno Overlay received public input and City received rude awakening...
Ripp..where the heck u been on that anti private property rights pile of convoluted, restrictive anti small business owner deceptive "fairhope image" piece of crap? Neither Planning dept nor P&amp;Z told truth at all at last weeks public meeting. Read the ordinance then watch their bs on that video.
