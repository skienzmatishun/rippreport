 I found something pretty interesting.  Look at this website.

http://www.utpsyc.org/synch/

It analyzes two texts and tells you the chances that it is the same author.

I took this article, titled To Grover, From Coastal Alabama
https://thebaldwininsider.wordpress.com/

And his farewell article,
https://www.gulfcoastnewstoday.com/stories/a-farewell-of-sorts,75752?

Who knows how effective the analysis is.  But this was the result.

Your LSM score is 0.83

Compared to other emails that we have analyzed, your LSM score is slightly above average To give you an idea, most LSM scores for emails range between .75 and .95, with an average around .84. The more that the two people are paying attention to each other in their interaction, the higher the LSM.

It goes on to say the analysis is experimental. So take that into account.  If anyone has some time on their hands, try more of his articles against the blog posts.
