 My neighbor in the f and n district is a retired biologist. He has been testing the bay water on a weekly basis since January. He said the bay is filthy and has raw sewage levels unbecoming of a modern American city. He says it is uncivilized and nearing epidemic levels if someone gets a flesh earing bacterium. Meanwhile Burrell is building more neighborhoods.
