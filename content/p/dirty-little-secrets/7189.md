 You are correct about the lack of local journalists.   Just look at it he northwest corner of Pollard and County Road 64 at that roundabout.    All those apartments going in on that two lane road and I cannot find a SINGLE news article covering that catastrophe that is going to happen 
The Mobile Register is too busy running Shoe Station ads and  Coast Media is too busy running puff pieces.
