 So you moved here for the schools?  HA!  So did just about everybody else!
That's what happens when the parents who take their kids to the ball fields, chat with the local politicians, think they are so great, and elect them to office.
Next time get really involved with what is happening in town.  There is more than the church and the ball fields.
Catalyst is so imbedded in the churches ("Christian Conservative" - gag) and the city ball leagues ("Oh wow, this man is a Christian and he is one of us") that they swoon the people into voting for them then they go to work for the same people that are crowding you out.
The joke is on you...
