 I sure miss Cliff writing his "Baldwin Insider" blog.  His writing style, though biased for the builders and the Catalyst Group, was pithy and humorous.
I think his BEST blog was about comparing the Baldwin County municipalities to SEC teams - very clever and insightful.
I think that he could have been more fair if only he enabled his comments at the end of each of his blogs.
He just suddenly stopped after his article about the Judge of Probate race.
