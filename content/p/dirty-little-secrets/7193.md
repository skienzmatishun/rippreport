 Well I remember a certain person being at events then including the comments in the Baldwin Insider.   When that blog was being written I tried to connect dots to figure out who was writing that blog.  Cliff would be at an event and then it would appear in the Baldwin Insider.   I can remember three events that follow this deductive reasoning.
It had to be a Catalyst-affiliated person or persons.   At the same time Haygood was running afoul of Catalyst, then Baldwin Insider started to disparage him calling him “Supreme Leader Haygood” and comparing him to Vanderbilt in the SEC.
Also remember his old account was shut down and he had to hurriedly start a Wordpress platform quickly which could explain the omission of removing placeholder text.    
I can not argue with you because I cannot be be sure either way.
While I did not agree with his reasoning I did like his clever writing.  If I would come face to face with whoever it was I would want to shake him then shake his hand
Thank you for replying to my earlier conjecture and bringing your good points to my attention
