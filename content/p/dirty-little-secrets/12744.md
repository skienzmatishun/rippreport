 Hey you people that recent moved in Fairhope:
Just a few years ago Fairhope was a wonderful place to live.  Low taxes, you could swim in the bay, you could find a parking place downtown and shop at a store that served the local residents and not the tourists, low taxes, and it was a small town.
But now, you bought into the realtorsâ€™ bull and overpaid for a house in a subdivision east of town.   You wanted something that you will never have here.
