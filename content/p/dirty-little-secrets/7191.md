 Not really a fan of Baldwin Insider, but the comments were enabled. He or she did take a while to approve them.  I commented some criticism a couple times and they eventually showed up.  I really don't believe that was Cliff writing the blog. I don't know him personally, but I imagine he has to spend a good amount of time in front of a computer.  I find it hard to believe that he wouldn't figure out how to change the default theme that came with his WordPress account.  Most of the placeholder text that is present when you first start a blog.  If you click the about page, it has the default image and the text 

"This is an example of an about page. Unlike posts, pages are better suited for more timeless content that you want to be easily accessible, like your About or Contact information. Click the Edit link to make changes to this page or add another page."

I find it hard to believe a journalist would not want or know how to remove that.  It would be much more likely to be someone unfamiliar with computers.

Also, the blog really dropped off right around the time Karin fired the first couple of people.  I forget their names.  I suspect it was one of them or a friend.
