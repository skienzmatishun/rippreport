 The media is compensated because it runs ads and no longer makes money on real journalism.   So you get crime stories, pictures of school activities, superficial lifestyle pieces
None of the media (Mobile Register and Gulf Coast Media) would covet a story about the rape of Baldwin.  The Fairhope Times mainly covers plantings on city streets.
The Lagniappe will run some, but it had to go and cover concerts.   
So that leaves Ripp to actually connect the dots.   
I would bet two things:  
1.  He had more page views than Gulf Coast Media and,
2.  The two former “news outlets” wonder why Ripp has such a high page view rating
