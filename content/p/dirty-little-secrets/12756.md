 Baykeepers has failed as an organization. Jubilees are a thing of the pass. Were once regular like good fishing from the pier and fish you could actually eat. The slime and muck that is Mobile Bay is proof that overdevelopment is here. The sickos on the council believe that you can actually keep building as much as you want and fairhope will not suffer. They have all made a fortune. Jack gets the payoffs and divvies it up. Sick little setup they have going. The land deal made them millionaires. Nobody said nothing. Robert Brown also made bank and ran off. The place is the scene of a crime. Wake up Fairhope! Your council is corrupt as the bay is sh*T!!!
