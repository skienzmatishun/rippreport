 I am confused.  One of your articles stated that Botop's position was defunded as soon as she moved here. Does that mean that she has never been paid and that is why she left?  Can you be more transparent as to what actually happened here? I remember when she was first hired and we were all a bit skeptical as to why she drew such a large salary, but I think that she has truly delivered to the City.  The City Council operates in secrecy (IMHO).
