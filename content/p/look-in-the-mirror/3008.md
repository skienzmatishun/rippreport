 After verifying with the Baldwin County Probate election of record for votes cast in the Republican US Senate race the results are as follows: Baldwin CO.

Luther Strange 32%
Roy Moore 30%
Trip Pittman 22%
Mo Brooks 14 %
Trip Pittman would not have made the run off even if just BaldCounty Voted. Damn Shame. But maybe the few that voted for him will finally realize what a terrible person he is. Boom boom Tripp Pittman or should I say 7% statewide Trip  Pittman. Other equipment companies  (heavy, middle Tractors,  etc) get ready. The bids are going to start having some of your names on it. Especially those that Pittman Tractor Company has been getting even when a lot of the bid says no one and Pittman Tractor gets them!!!
