Only 17% of the registered voters in the state, voted in the senate primary. Fairhope had only 14% vote.

What are we left with, Luther Strange who as our leading law enforcement officer allowed the Luv Gov. to walk in exchange for Jeff Sessions seat. Mr Strange, as Attorney General also allowed Sen. Pittman to walk with 750,000 dollars of BP money and never mentioned the anchors he left in the Bay, while others were prosecuted for far less BP crimes. Strange as it may seem big Luther now faces multiple ethics complaints.

Then we have Roy Moore the states supreme court justice who was thrown off the bench for breaking the law, TWICE. The only state in the United States that can make that claim. What do you think congress and the US Senate is going to think when they find out Alabama has the potential of sending a twice dis barred supreme court justice to join them in the swamp?

Let’s not forget the conviction of the Alabama speaker of the house.

What about the recent revelations of the Alabama Ethics Commission,

The above should concern you as citizens of the state because their actions, and ours for not voting, have firmly secured Alabama as number one in political corruption.

You will have to hold your nose when you vote in December for the US Senate seat, or you can stop looking left and right and screaming conservative and liberal. Start looking at what is best for the state and it’s citizens and use your brain instead of the straight ticket voting that you have been sold on by the very politicians we need to rid ourselves of.

Baldwin County provides almost 35% of Alabama’s income and is the fastest growing county in Alabama. The County Commission should be replaced by fresh faces and the existing commissioners shown the door. Sen. Pittman’s seat is also open and desperately needs to be filled by a candidate that represents the district and not his personal business.

So if you wonder why Alabama is number one in corruption, 46th in education and the least desirable state to live in, LOOK IN THE MIRROR.
