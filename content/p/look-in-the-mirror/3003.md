 Great article; however, it is heartbreaking how willfully stupid Alabama voters are.   I applaud your efforts to expose the corruption.  I have made negative comments about Wilson's advisors and I stand behind them; however, I understand why you are protective of Mayor Wilson. This is the first 'light of day' that Fairhope has seen in decades.  Is there a possibility of an audit as to the dollars spent on the 'sewer system', the massive failure of which was 'unavoidable' according to the City Council President, Jack Burrell?  On what continent, are sewer system failures unavoidable?  I would very much like to know where every dollar of the 13 million went!  I am a semi-retired accountant and would be happy to work with anyone to get to the bottom of these dollars. 

Fairhope is fabulous but was taken to the brink of destruction by the Burrell fools.

I think that our Mayor is finally getting some traction since the 'unavoidable' sewage spills.  Those who were trying to destroy her must be hating this week because she has been proven right on everything! Go, Karin Wilson!
And, I must add, even those who hate Wilson are happy that Pittman and Burrell are on the way out!
