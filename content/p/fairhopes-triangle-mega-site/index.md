## DEAD LAST![](https://cdn.rippreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/mega-site2.jpg)

Mid term elections will again bring up all the advantages of the Baldwin County Mega site. Politicians, county commissioners and their hacks, all on board with the annual round of promises that the…

Fairhope’s Mega-Site is the Triangle property and just like the County’s Mega-Site, politicians have saddled the tax payers with the debt while satisfying a few good ole boys and select developers.

Liar Liar pants on fire, leading the charge to keep the triangle from being developed is Councilman Burrell and Boone. They are lying through their teeth to the entire community now and have been for 6 years about the “settlement” vs. Park. They did have the support of the city hired attorneys who supported the lies that later came to the surface, after 3 million in legal fees.

THE TRIANGLE PROPERTY WAS PURCHASED BY THE CITY OF FAIRHOPE TO “SETTLE” A LAWSUIT.

Mr. Burrell and Boone want you to believe it was a voluntary purchase for a City Park, that is absolutely false. They want to declare the property as a conservation easement, insuring nothing can be built on the property.

Four years and $1.6 million later, the city of Fairhope reached a settlement agreement Nov. 7 with the Alabama Municipal Insurance Corporation (AMIC) over the reimbursement of attorneys fees charged to litigate a lawsuit over a rejected retail development. Mayor Tim Kant said the tentative settlement will leave the city on the hook for $500,000, …

The lawsuit settlement cost the City 11.25 million dollars, 3 million in attorney fees, for attorneys who promised us that the City would pay no attorney fees and would win the lawsuit. Wrong on both counts.

The purchase also had some tax incentives favoring the sellers. The estimated value, today, is somewhere between 16 and 20 million dollars. The last City council, Burrell and Boone, settled the lawsuit without any public participation, in fact they went to great length, with Mayor Kant, to keep the public in the dark.

The next thing to happen was Mayor Kant along with his water carriers, Burrell and Boone, tried to prove that the property was a park. They came up with a plan that was so bad that the first arrow never was released.

This Jewell of a project would have a price tag of 16 to 20 million in land cost and 2 million for development, 22 Million for an Archery Range, walking trail and what Kant called a “Arbortorium.”

Burrell and Boone want to have a City Council vote, asap, before any comprehensive plan of Fairhope. This should not happen, without a referendum or being vetted through public participation while developing a current and citizen approved Comprehensive plan.

The City of Fairhope will begin the Fairhope Area Community-based Comprehensive Land Use Plan, a 2-year project, with $650,000 RESTORE Act funding by the end of this year. It will serve as a guide …

Mayor Wilson worked for the last 18 months for the 17.2 million the city got from BP Restore funds. The 650,000 dollars for a Comprehensive Plan must include the Triangle property.

Fairhope you have a decision; Let Burrell and Boone, and most likely the Jester Brown, make a 20 million dollar decision for you or use the $650,000 Comprehensive Plan, that will include public participation, in determining the best use of the property for the community.

IT AIN’T THE MAYOR
