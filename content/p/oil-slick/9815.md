 "imagine a world in which candidates running for public office spoke only about their accomplishments, their positions on issues important to their constituents, and their visions for the future."

BP guy on paddle board sounds pretty patronizing. We are not idiots.  I appreciate the fact that Mayor Wilson sticks to accompliahments and vision.  She is the only one who has results.  

His innuendos are undermining our Mayor. Doesn't sound like good vibes to me.  Sounds like he makes a good candidate for a politician!

I don't need any more lessons from BP guy. 

Concern now is Sherry's Catalyst backing and the thought of going back to the good ol boy crap.  Mayor Wilson has brought the City forward and we do not don't want to go back to the old regime.
