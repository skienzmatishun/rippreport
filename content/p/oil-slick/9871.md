 Hey all you Quail Creek residents. Is this person one of the rude ass people who pull out Dangerously in front of you only to drive 10 mph less than the speed limit. Stay your butt in Quail Creek if you are?  Karen Wilson will always do what’s right for Fairhope and not what’s right for Burrell and the scumbags. Sounds like you need to get on a paddle board too!
