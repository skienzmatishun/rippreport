 I live in Quail Creek and I will not support Wilson- I will support Sherry Sullivan.  Wilson has not supported  Quail Creek subdivision nor the golf course in any way.  I suppose we live on the wrong side of hwy #181.  Myself and 5 other houses  have a drainage problem created by rain runoff coming from  the golf course.  After 5 cancelled, scheduled meetings, Wilson finally shows up and before she even gets back to see the problem, she is yelling that run off is the residents problem in every case - without even looking at the problem.  It cost me $7,000 to fix THE CITYS PROBLEM!  However; when Firethorne subdivision ( not in the city at that time) had the same type problem, the mayor authorized a concrete drainage system and redirected the runoff to protect them.  It’s obvious to me, she puts no value on Quail Creek subdivision  nor the city’s own golf course.
