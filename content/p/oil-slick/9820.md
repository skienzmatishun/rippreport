 I see where Manelos thought by putting F——g in his opening statement was cool. Well, it’s not John Manelos to use anything close to that word. Very typical of outsiders that come here. We don’t want anyone who uses that language to be here in Fairhope much less than be in public office. Yes, unfortunately we have a few that do and we are working on getting rid of them as we speak.
