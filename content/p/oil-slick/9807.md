 I met John Manelos' wife. She is lovely.  What is the problem?
I believe that Karin has worked hard but she will never be able to work cohesively with our current council members.  IMHO, John Manelos would be a great Mayor that will not bring back the Kant era disasters that may come with Sherry Sullivan. He is not only well educated and extremely informed of the issues, he truly loves Fairhope.
