Sorry for a repeat article. Eye procedures have prevented me from seeing, however this particular post has become more factual, since the General Election.

Wake up Fairhope the “at large” catalyst council is the worst, least effective council Fairhope has seen in 20 years. They say they represent us all, however they cannot even pass a budget.

The budget NOT being passed is deliberate, meant to obstruct the Mayor and City Supervisors and you are paying with your tax dollars, for the obstruction. Catalyst is running the Council.
