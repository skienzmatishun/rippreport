 Well Sandy, Karin Wilson took the step you suggest to others, to get involved and fight back.  For a year she tried to convince everyone she knew to run against Kant but his hold on Fairhope, coupled with his henchmen, was scary and nobody wanted to make the effort against what seemed like insurmountable odds. But when she got to the end of her list and listened to every single person say "no", she shrugged and said well, I guess I'll have to do it myself.  And who knew - it worked!

Now as it turns out, she may have had more leverage had she run for a Council seat as it's becoming clearer and clearer that the Mayor, with no votes, doesn't have much power to actually change things if the Council routinely votes against everything she suggests and wants.

Now though, the Council is ripe to be picked off.  Who likes them?  Nobody.  The next election is the time we have the best chance to make good things happen for Fairhope.  Replace every damn one of them but most especially, get rid of Jack.  He's the puppetmaster of the other four (I mean seriously, have you ever seen a more pathetic group of cowed men in your life?) and I suspect we'd see a lot more forward progress on what's needed with him gone.
