 Let's see who wants to save Fairhope from the goobers or who would rather sip their ripple and pretend to be "rich" on their porch. All of these jerks can be defeated. It is a small municipal election. It doesn't take money it takes woman/man/power and want to. we can take our community back from these greedy, self-serving pigs but we have to want it. That means sacrificing some time and energy and money--if everybody does we will have created a new fairhope. If we don't get control fairhope will never recover and I am scared to say what I see it will be like in 20 years.
