 The second bid coming in after the deadline is a problem for the prospective bidder. You can't accept it according to state law. You can however reject all bids (since they only had one) and do them over.  The fact they didn't open the late bid is not a problem for the Council nor the Mayor. The fact the Council awarded a bid with only one bidder is up for debate. They have been hesitant to do this previously though.
