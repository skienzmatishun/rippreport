 Well, a meeting was held  in Fairhope about the total delay &amp; lack of work by Arrington Curb &amp; Excavating at the roundabout under construction  at Gayfer Avenue &amp; County Road 13.  It was to be complete by September 8th, extended to September. 15th &amp; now November 3rd.  They are NOT on the job many days &amp; sometimes weeks at a time.  So - we are now giving them an extension - what a joke so they can work like they have been working!!  Commissioner Chris Elliott was in attendance &amp; lead the meeting.  A lot of it had to do with STATE bureaucracy..  State Representative JOE FAUST KNEW about the meeting &amp; did NOT attend.  What a good representative of the people!!  Joe Faust is nothing but a Howdy Doody guy &amp; Baby Kisser!   He does not know or care to do anything that helps his constitutes!!   Heard he is going to run again - HA - he needs to be voted out - all he cares is about the social part of it!!  Someone needs to step up &amp; run against him!
