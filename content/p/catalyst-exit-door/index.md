Baldwin County Commission, District No. 3, Please show Tucker Dorsey, not his real name, the exit door. Mr. Dorsey is the equivalent to Mr Burrell in Fairhope. Both men are about both men, they do not represent their constituents and have very poor performance records. Dorsey has burnt so many bridges that it is a miracle that he can find Clarence Burke’s house.

Tucker is probable ready to go anyway, he came to office with an empty wallet, now he’s got the big truck, custom glasses and a few million dollars and a new house, all while holding office. Between his many LLC’s, Baldwin County Sewer and his “private” business, it is a wonder he can keep up with County Business or stays out of the pool.

Mr. Dorsey may have made a few million, however Baldwin County Citizens are left with the “dump” Mega Site and countless lost opportunities.

Tucker Dorsey should be thrown out the exit door, over the mega-site and loss of 35 million, now in undeveloped scrub. Most important should be the lost opportunity of that money. County infrastructure and county employees were ignored for this good ole boy deal.

{{< socialpreview url="https://rippreport.com/p/economic-development-baldwin-county-style/" >}}

Tucker Dorsey and Chris Elliott then lied to the taxpayers and passed a 1% tax for schools, WITHOUT A VOTE FROM THE PEOPLE, that the county skimmed 4 million a year off, for infrastructure. They spent the money on a good ole boy deal and then robbed the schools to make up the difference. 4 million a year is 40 million every 10 years! Think about that!
