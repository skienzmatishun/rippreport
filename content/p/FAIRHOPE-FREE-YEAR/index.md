I bet only 1 or 2% of the voters in Fairhope know that not one city council person, the mayor or the appointed municipal attorney and municipal judge have been elected or appointed for there 5th year in office. The Alabama legislature thought it necessary to postpone municipal elections in 2024 due to the presidential election. A free year in office, full family insurance and the ability to make decisions for Fairhope's future, without a single vote cast. Only in Alabama.

“Fairhope has had a water shortage for the last three years running. The sewer and infrastructure projects that were approved in 2020 have yet to be completed and we are in year 5. The sewer plant is beyond capacity and still discharges into the Bay. Growth has exploded with over a 1000 homes, condo and townhouses already approved for the future. Schools are bursting at the seams and municipalities are abandoning the public schools. Traffic has increased without any new roads. Lawsuits against the city are now in vogue again, costing taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars.”

FREE SPEECH / PUBLIC PARTICIPATION

Not only does the Council and Mayor get a free year they are now considering doing away with public participation. For those that do not follow the council the public is allowed 3 minuets to address the council about a council agenda before the meeting begins and 3 minutes after the meeting for non agenda issues. Three minutes that's all folks! But that seems to be too damn much brain damage for our non-elected municipal government.

{{< socialpreview url="https://fairhopeal.portal.civicclerk.com/event/150/files/agenda/644" >}}

>Ordinance - An Ordinance amending Ordinance No. 1692; the Rules of Procedure in all instances for the Meetings of the City Council: Section IX; Remove 12. Public Participation (Non-Agenda Items)

So now if you have anything to say it has to be on the agenda. The Mayor and Council, UN-elected this year, are now taking away your fundamental rights of free speech

Fairhope has already been sued for refusing to allow yours truly from speaking.

Full title:FRANCIS PAUL RIPP, Plaintiff, v. JACK BURRELL, etc., Defendant.

Court:UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF ALABAMA SOUTHERN

{{< socialpreview url="https://gulfcoastmedia.com/the-courier/stories/local-blogger-settles-lawsuit-against-fairhope-council,68855" >}}

>“Today The Ripp Report is going to pay all of their attorney fees, the company American Express Card, the accountant, advertising bills, the computer services and bank charges,” Ripp wrote. “This is the first time The Ripp Report has been in the black in years. The balance of money will be used to further the efforts of The Ripp Report, thanks to Council President Burrell.”

Fairhope was told by the judge that they did not want to come back to her court.



FAIRHOPE get together and find some candidates for next years election or this group, elected, Un-elected, and supported by developers, will do what ever the hell they want and you will not be able to say a word.
