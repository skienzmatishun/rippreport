 One post I saw from the company website for the hygiene products reflected concern over not being able to find one out of a million inane, hateful, spiteful &amp; totally outta touch statements made by Speaker (ugh!) Pelosi.  Supposedly the writer had seen somewhere a quote by her saying, "Nature culls the herd," which is true but unbelievably crass &amp; unkind but hey...that's our CA whack for ya!  Writer expressed concern that she could not Google &amp; find it again because her Jewish friends, typically left-wing, arrogant, &amp; boorish, called her ignorant or something. I would say to this woman, tell your TDS-afflicted Jewish friends to stfu &amp; close their condescending pie-holes!
