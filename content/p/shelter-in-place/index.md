Stay home. Since the report below was posted, in less than 12 hours, the number of cases has risen by 136 cases and deaths are at 36.

The Governor has resisted giving the statewide order for “stay at home” or “Shelter in Place”. Her foolish decision is based on the people pulling her strings.

I predict that even the puppet masters will have to accept the inevitable and join the rest of the United States and stay home for a couple of weeks to reevaluate the situation.

News Flash! You can catch the coronavirus in Church or at the Beach.

We are all in this together that means we ALL need to cooperate and work with one another. Our health depends on it.

In Baldwin County each of the 14 municipalities is handling the virus independently.

This will not work.

Bay Minette does very little and has a wait and see approach.

Orange Beach has allowed large crowds on islands.

Fairhope’s Mayor has written the Governor and implored her to institute a statewide “shelter in Place”, while other municipalities remain mute. We have all got to get on the same page.

Ask yourself where is the PLAN?

Where are the tests?

Where are the ventilators?

SHELTER IN PLACE

JUST ANNOUNCED ALABAMA WILL ORDER “Shelter in Place” Saturday. FINALLY, now

Cooperate. The life you save may be your own.
