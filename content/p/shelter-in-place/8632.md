 I think Pelosi said that back in 2010 or 2014 midterm election just before the House of Representatives lost the Democrat majority
Just before that midterm election, Pelosi was asked by a reporter about several Democrat House members who were going to lose their re-election.  I remover her answer was about “culling the herd.”
No I did not google it and that is all I can remember
