 Alabama is right.  They lock down New York, Italy, and Spain and they still have cases. Whatâ€™s more the economy goes to trash.    
I say open up the economy and nature will take care of the rest.   Before you harp about New Orleans keep in mind the health of those.   Notice how the news is not talking about the pre-existing conditions?   Notice how in Iceland over 50% of those are asymptomatic?  So for 5% we ALL are suffering
So yes, Alabama is right 
Or you can do what New York is doing an see that locking up the people is not having an effect but it will get Coumo nominated.
