 FYI... THE UAE houses more US NAVY ships than any foreign nation and is strategically crucial to presence in the Middle East. That and it was Saudi Arabia with ties to 9-11... With Hillary involved, and who was secretary of state at the time... go figure that as part of a deal to house US warships in their ports, that we as a nation negotiated a public/private partnership for a UAE based corporation to manage two US ports. They are a NATO ally. 

Ofcourse we could have just had congress appropriate the funds from the budget, right? I mean big government deficits were the way of the land under the Obama Administration, Right? 

Paul I challenge you to refute in lieu of delete my comments.
