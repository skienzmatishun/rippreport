 Hey Eagle Scout. The other day you posted a very bad curse word but you did not spell it out correctly and that helped. If you are planning to continue this or give opinions, whether right or wrong. How about using a different handle. We Eagle Scout are asking to please stop using Eagle Scout. Iâ€™m sure you will not pay attention and if you think you are an Eagle Scout?  You would understand in the first place. Thanks for listening
