 From the pieces of what you are telling,  Alabama took the federal money and put it into the Port at the cost of the bridge so the Arabs could lead the port and make the residents pick up the cost of the bridge by putting a toll on the bridge. 
If this is the case then the politicians have sold us out to the UAE.   These politicians are for sale and when they sell themselves they then sell us.
