I am reluctantly back from a three week vacation and trying to get back on the Ripp Report horse. Let’s review a few subjects that have been in the news in my absence.

First the [Fairhope Waterfront](https://rippreport.com/tag/fairhope-waterfront/) project has been getting progressively worse. What started out as a citizen driven grant has turned into a political hot potato. The project has been whittled down to a stub.

The [council](https://rippreport.com/tag/city-council/) and [Mayor](https://rippreport.com/tag/sullivan/) are on different pages and some concerned citizens are beginning to see the true colors of Council President Burrell.

The grant for 6.2 million was for “stabilizing” the bluff.

The city has abandoned that idea.

The grant also demanded ADA access, now the city is playing games with what ADA “access” really means.

This grant has requirements and was awarded on its merits. Changing the plans and requirements after being awarded the bid may have serious consequences.

“Despite opposition, the Fairhope City Council approved the proposed scope of work for its $6.2 million, RESTORE Act-funded “working waterfront and green space project” Monday night”

The Fairhope City Council does what they want, opposition be damned.

Please remember The Ripp Report predicted these problems.

The [medical marijuana](https://rippreport.com/tag/medical-cannabis/) bill looks as if it is going to pass, it is headed for Governor Ivy’s signature.

The Alabama gaming bill is moving through the Senate and we could have an answer soon.

Alabama prisons are in limbo as to weather the state will have for profit prisons or the legislature will do their job.

The most interesting news in the last couple of weeks was that of [Sheriff Hoss Mack](https://rippreport.com/tag/mack/) having to face Federal Court, WITHOUT QUALIFIED IMMUNITY

{{< socialpreview url="https://www.lagniappemobile.com/news/qualified-immunity-denied-for-baldwin-sheriff-deputy-in-fatal-2017-shooting/article_b3531805-43fa-5abf-9b28-b05e815511f7.html" >}}

> “Deputy Hunady had time to plan for what would happen if and when Victor did exit the vehicle and behaved erratically (which was entirely foreseeable given the reports of his erratic behavior inside the vehicle before Deputy Hunady arrived on the scene),” Cassady wrote. “He had time to make arrangements for the safety of law enforcement, first responders and members of the public. He had time to speak with witnesses to determine what, exactly, they had seen that might ‘possibly’ have been a gun when they interacted with Victor. He had time to consider non-lethal force options, such as the Taser he was carrying on his person. He had time to consider calling in the BCSO’s negotiation team. All of these elements were within Deputy Hunady’s control, not Victor’s.”

The defendants argued Mack was entitled to qualified immunity

“because there is no evidence of any such pattern of misconduct, which is a necessary precondition for a finding of deliberate indifference.”

The problem for Sheriff Mack is that he has a well established pattern, and conduct, of “deliberate indifference. The sheriff department has two more cases climbing the legal ladder where loss of life by the hands of the sheriff’s office has demonstrated “deliberate indifference”.

For years the Baldwin County Sheriff Office, headed by Hoss Mack has hidden behind Qualified Immunity and has avoided any accountability. In 2022 Hoss may retire, let’s hope so. If he does not retire he will face a lot of public scrutiny.

For 8 months, The Ripp Report has been working on a case involving the Baldwin County Sheriff and will soon go public with a story that should disturb every citizen in Alabama.

This particular case demonstrates what a poor judicial system exists Baldwin County as well as shines a lot of light on Sheriff Hoss Mack.

{{< socialpreview url="https://www.lagniappemobile.com/news/local/adem-holds-public-hearing-on-plant-barry-coal-ash-pond/article_a3a5b235-b6c7-5198-855e-5f2fe908170b.html" >}}

The only other news or lack of news is the Coal Ash Pond at Berry Steam Plant. Alabama Power keeps telling the general public not to worry. I guess they forgot about the BP spill.

ADEM the Department of Environmental Management, aka, the Department of Environmental Manics is holding public hearings on the coal ash. That alone should concern you.

A special thanks to [Mobile Baykeeper](https://rippreport.com/tag/mobile-baykeeper/) and all the non-profits and citizens that have voiced their concerns about the dangers of the existing coal ash ponds. It should be mentioned that elected politicians have done little.

They need that Alabama Power contribution money for the next election.
