All of us have read news articles that have driven us up the wall, but this article and story is insane and most likely a perfect example of someone with power who wants his own way. What the Ripp Report calls political corruption.

That someone, is stepping on the feet of county commissioners and the Zoning department. The County Commissioners are now going to have to take a stand in a situation that should never have reached the controversy it has.

{{< socialpreview url="https://utv44.com/news/local/tough-battle-ahead-for-baldwin-county-business-proposal" >}}

“A small business venture on family land”, a venture by a young entrepreneur, Grant Weeks, from a family, The Weeks family of Weeks Bay, that is part of History in Baldwin County. That alone should get your attention.

First the Zoning Commission agreed to recommend the restaurant, then after considering one complaint they reverse course and now recommend against the zoning request to the County Commission. At this point you need to hold your noise because something stinks, BAD.

Now the applicants have to go before the County Commission Dec. 15 2020, in Bay Minette. If the Commissioners vote against it, the applicants must wait a year to reapply. The County Commissioners should also be asked to request a traffic light at County Road 49 and 26. The intersection should have a light already installed, it is dangerous as is.

Here is what you can do:

A. [Sign the petition](https://www.ipetitions.com/petition/rezone-weeks-farm)

B. Contact a County Commissioners

C. Come to the meeting in support, Dec. 15 @ 9:00 AM

Pay particular attention as to what elected official or officials vote no, then vote their ass out next election.

Please sign the petition in support and join the 555 supporters so far.

Watch this short video then ask yourself what the hell is going on?

The Ripp Report does not personally know any of the Weeks Family but would be proud to meet them. I look forward to eating at their Creole Restaurant.
