 lots of straw men.....in the pockets of the developers. They count, we don't....   as the saying is, money talks and ....walks. People are too busy and  distracted to keep an eye on their own government that's why we get this. They know few are interested. Don't bother me I'm shopping or watching the stupid tv god and sucking up lies.
