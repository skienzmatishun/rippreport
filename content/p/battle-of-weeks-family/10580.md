 Apparently the Weeks Family isn't part of the "New" Baldwin County.  Over the decades I have seen the new powers-that-be move in and start calling new shots.
You see, if you don't run with the new elites, you are an outsider.  You have to be politically plugged in to the right people and kiss their rings.

We are becoming second class citizens in our own home town.
