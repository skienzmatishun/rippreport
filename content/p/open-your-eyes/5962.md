 Kay Ivey is a incompetent person that when interviewed by someone from the Media the other day seemed to not be able to answer any questions regarding what needs to happen in Alabama and she could only say what had already started before she became Governor of Alabama. Alabama is a disgrace to the world. Let Kay Ivey and Chris Elliott win, it goes to shit even further than it is. I’m a republican, but I have more sense to vote dumbasses in office. When you elect bad prople in office, it’s not only just your fault, but you are a stupid ass too!!!!
