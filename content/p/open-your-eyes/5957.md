 A ton of open-minded progressives are moving  here from the upper Midwest (like they did when the fstc was created) and from large urban areas around the country. These newcomers are changing the dynamic just as they have in urban southern centers like Atlanta and Houston. We want transparency, accountability, best practices, a healthy bay, etc. Not cronyism, insider dealing, environmental degradation, and corruption. The New South is coming to coastal Baldwin. We can feel the fresh breezes blowing and hear the whispers of progressive values.
