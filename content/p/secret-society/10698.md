 Hey peeps, are you serious or are you working for CSB?
Just look.  The mayor is working for the developers and the entire council is too
The city judge is a developer.  Catalyst puts on politicians who are owned by developers or are developers themselves
This is not a conspiracy theory but fact.   The shameful part is that the voters do not know this.   Because of Ripp, we know and are spreading the word.   I knew that Catalyst would have to go to ground after losing some elections.   I just never knew it would change its name to Boone
