 What a tangled web we weave when we practice to deceive...how ignorant are the people that we cannot hear this man ??? Why is no one speaking up against this council? Burrell looks desperate. It seems he knows his time is up for him and his loser thief friends on the council. Watch for many sketchy deals like the $2.6 million for recreation land. These are money grabs by a dying council still taking orders from their civilian masters...aka "Judge Sned". 

Wake up Fairhope. Your QOL is crap.
