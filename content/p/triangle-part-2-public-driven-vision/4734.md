 "We have plenty of room to grow." Can I get whatever you're smoking because that is the most idiotic false statement I've heard. I cant hardly make it from one side of town to the other without hitting a traffic jam. And don't even get me started on 98. I mean i get it JackFan, you've drunk the Kool-Aid and believe ole Dorsey, Boone and many like them and believe we should totally exhaust our resources and turn Fairhope and Daphne into Theodore 2.0 .I mean the facts speak for themselves when they legislate laws that keep developers from paying impact fees after dropping a few hundred homes out in the county and then allow them to use Fairhope schools. If that's the case why don't you move out to Montana where they have plenty of lush green land untouched by the filthy hands of developers and go ruin that state. As for us locals who actually care about our town, lets not. I mean hell, I say a prayer whenever I flush hoping i don't end up having to walk through it when it overflows.
