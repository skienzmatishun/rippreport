 The Fairhope Courier should have covered this topic but failed to cover the Triangle.  Mr Ripp you covered this thouroughly in one post that the Courier should have been covering all this time.  The lack of journalistic integrity of the Courier makes me sad when I can remember when it was a REAL newspaper.
I guess Chuckie was too busy having his nose up Booneâ€™s butt.
