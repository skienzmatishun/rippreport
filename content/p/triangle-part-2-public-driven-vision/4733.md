 Overcrowded schools, backed-up roads, overflowing sewers, and you say we have plenty of room to grow?  Where? In apartments?   You know that this type of unsustainable growth becomes slums in ten years.  
We will not “chill” because we know what happens.  Go back to your bosses at D R Horton , Belaton,  Truland Cox, and  the other megabuilders that would crowd us out and tell them we are on to you all.   We are going to fight you guys.   No more corruption as you steal our county.   GO BACk TO ATLANTA TUCKER!
