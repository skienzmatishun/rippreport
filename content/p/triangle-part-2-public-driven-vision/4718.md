 Things are not that bad, at least in Fairhope. They do have impact fees and they have recently raised them. I wish they would raise them more. I think they explained the State has limitations with respect to impact fees. Generally I want to see the highest permissible impact fees, tighter zoning, and zealous enforcement. They should not allow any more grinders. Fairhope reminds me of the US government. For years they have lived off utility money that should have been plowed back. Just like US government uses Social Security money which should have been set aside to cover benefits. Well come to think of it I guess things are pretty bad. I think the new Mayor gets it. She just needs to realize that everyone in the city doesnâ€™t need to be a city employee. Employees cost money too.
