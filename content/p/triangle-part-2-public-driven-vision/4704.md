 Here is what will happen:  As the sewer plant gets overtaxed, the schools get overcrowded, and the roads get over crowded, you will hear the city and county officials say we need more taxes to fund "more infrastructure."  
The reason that we have the overburdened infrastructure is because the people who are currently running the county are the developers who are ruining the county.  They don't care about stressing the county - they are just making money off the developments and leaving us the ones to pay for the mess they are making.  They should have had to pay impact fees but they, being on the County Commission and City Councils of Daphne, Spanish Fort, and Fairhope, blocked the fees.  They are the reason for the out of control growth that we all will have to pay for.
