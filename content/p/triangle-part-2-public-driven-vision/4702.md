 If the land were to be developed, how should it be developed?  Park? Recreational facility? I see where it is a very valuable piece of land and that some thought really needs to go into how it should be developed.
If millions have been paid to acquire the land then yes - the City of Fairhope would do well to get "buy in" from as many of its residence.  
To say the land will not be developed is a fantasy.  Eventually it WILL get developed down the road.  Decide and commit now so everyone knows.
I would like to see it remain woods forever but I know this is not going to happen.  But I also  do not want to see it sold off and have another subdivision plopped down on it.  Put the land in the Comprehensive Plan so that it will not be carved back out to appease a special interest in the future.
