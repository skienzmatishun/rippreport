 The reality is that appraisal number or no, no one would pay a big figure to buy the triangle for any business purpose. Imagine the uproar if someone developed the property after all the past fighting. Imagine the zoning and development hassles.  At the end of the day the only question
is do the people want au naturel or walking paths.  Eventually both “sides” will solicit the people as to which way to go. Both sides are going to have to end up doing this and there is no good reason not to go ahead and set up a way to determine the way the folks want it. No one is stupid enough to try to sell the property for development and no developer is stupid enough to pay much for it. No matter which “side” you  are on (everyone seems to think the other “side” is horrible) at least give the other side credit to do the obvious.

If you want to make wisecracks about my comment I’ll remind  everyone when things happen exactly how I am saying. It will be THIS year.
