 Look you Ripp fans need to get over yourselves. We have plenty of room to grow in Fairhope and we need more people to get to where we need to be to compete for new business. We need high paying jobs in fairhope and the only way we get airport jobs and big companies to locate here is to have plenty of cheap labor. For that we need more than retirees. Wake up and realize that Fairhope is the fastest growing city in AL for a good reason. We rock! We are a great community! We were great before Mayor Wilson and we will be great after!!
