 Fairhope was great until the Good Ole Boys linked up with those that moved in from Georgia (Tucker Dorsey and Haygood), linked up with Lynn Stacey, and formed Elliott, Haygood, and Stacey and collected money from the mega home builders to put them in office.   After this tumor metasticized into Catalyst it then corrupted politicians to work for developers and approve any project that would make them money. 
The Catalyst cancer has now spread to the Courier and is soreading to the library.  Ripp fans know this.  So no, we will NOT chill until the Catalyst cancer is out in remission.
