 Haygood is one of the kingpins of Cataktst.  Catalyst was once called “Elliott, Haygood and Stacey.”   
Haygood is a real estate developer on the commercial side so he works hand in glove with the subdivision builders like D R Horton, Truland, and Belaton.  Haygood will tell you he came from the Gulf Cosdt yet went to Georgia for college, learned computers and how to work them forcelections and real estate, hooked up with Tucker, and moved here to exploit our Baldwin County. 
 Coleman who Haygood put on the council works for D R Horton.  Cox (Belaton) and Truland are big contributors to Haygood.   Look at Secretary of State reports and see.   It is a FILTHY situation this is. Yet these guys call themselves Christians.
Old Field is part of Daphne but is in Fairhope territory because Haygood wanted the houses yet the kids there go to Fairhope schools.
