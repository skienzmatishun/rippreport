Mid term elections will again bring up all the advantages of the Baldwin County Mega site. Politicians, county commissioners and their hacks, all on board with the annual round of promises that the mega site, will soon pay off. Never mind that this is the same story since the purchase in mid 2011.

This is a 32 million dollar investment with tens of millions of lost opportunity. The county commission still has the original sign advertising the project. That sign is now faded as the promises of the commission have faded.

We are told we came in second and almost won a car manufacturing plant, BS. We never even came close.

You talk about spin! This is classic, we the citizens of Baldwin County, after investing 32 million, are now being told there are no mega sites in Alabama left except the one in Baldwin County. So we are dead last, but the only choice? That is one hell of a sales pitch.

Truth of the matter is the same county commission and the Baldwin County Economic Development Alliance want you to bend over one more time and put the same damn commissioners back in office. Vote the incumbents out and stand up straight.

The Baldwin County Economic Alliance had the same sales pitch for the Fairhope Airport and the results are the same, DEAD LAST.
