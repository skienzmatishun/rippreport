The Attorney General, Ethics Commission and the Alabama Bar all wear the same dirty underwear. They protect one another, and politicians, from pesky political complaints and play a legal shuffle that results in whitewashing their culpability. It is perfectly clear that the Attorney General will always side with the Bar or Ethics. The Bar and Ethics depend on the Attorney General to cover their back.

As a citizen of Alabama you cannot expect any justice, accountability, or investigation into any complaint involving political corruption.

The Attorney General was given a pass, by the Ethics Commission for pac to pac contributions. Then the ethics commission said it was illegal for any Democrat to do the same thing.

{{< socialpreview url="https://www.al.com/news/2018/06/political_money_laundering_ag.html" >}}

A decade ago, before the Alabama Legislature passed the ban in 2010, tracking campaign finances in this state was nearly impossible. By shifting money from one political action committee to another, a cabal of lobbyists, consultants and political fixers laundered millions in campaign cash every election cycle. The lines from special interest groups to the candidates they sponsored were untraceable.

Please get a Lagniappe and read this article and you will see why Alabama is number one in the United States for being the most politically corrupt. The Ethics Commission sugarcoats 17 violations. The Bar Association and the Attorney General do nothing, no criminal charges are filed.

>“The Bar Association also paid McCallum $37,437 in August 2021, roughly 10 months after he resigned. The Bar has not explained why he received those perks after resigning while under investigation by the Ethics Commission

>McCallum was fined $100,000 by the Alabama Ethics Commission for his violations, but faced no criminal prosecution from the Attorney General’s Office.”

The Ethics Commission’s Executive Director, Tom Albritton, has got a pass from the Ethics Commission, Alabama Bar and the Attorney General. The only recourse for any justice is to file a civil suit against Mr Albrittion the trustees and the bank. This is blatant in your face corruption.

>“Albritton was confirmed by the State Senate as executive director of the Alabama Ethics Commission in March 2015, and that same year, two of his children received $15,000 scholarships to the University of Texas from the trust, according to 990 records. Overall, scholarships to Albritton’s children totaled $105,000 between 2014 and 2018, which is the last year for which the trust’s 990s are available, so it is possible there was more scholarship money distributed to them.

“The trustee shall not engage in any act of self-dealing as defined in section 4941(d), and shall not make any taxable expenditures as defined in section 5489,” it reads.

The Internal Revenue Service Section 4941(d) description of self-dealing would appear to prohibit a trust from paying tuition or other expenses for a trustee’s child or children, as that would directly benefit the trustee, referred to in the will as a “disqualified person.”

The Bar and the Attorney General saw nothing wrong with the Ethics Executive Director “self Dealing”

{{< socialpreview url="https://rippreport.com/p/writ-of-mandamus-update/" >}}

You would think that the media would be on this story like a dog in heat! However so far the Ethics Commission and the Bar Association see no problem with Mr Albritton receiving more than 120,000 dollars for his children’s education, from a trust where he is a trustee. The absurdity of their justifications of Mr. Albritton, further exposes the depth of corruption.

Mr Albritton is the Executive Director of the Ethics Commission. His actions as a trustee, which he has admitted to in Lagniappe articles, should require him to resign from the Ethics Commission, immediately.

The Ethics complaints filed by The Ripp Report involved a Municipal Judge, Councilman and Council President, State Senator and a district judge sitting as a circuit judge, without being elected to the position. These complaints as well as hundreds of other complaints filed by citizens, always get quashed by the dirty underwear trio.

The Corruption and incompetency of the Alabama Bar, Ethics Commission and Attorney General are if full view. When they are challenged they start squawking about Guns, Abortion, Immigration or liberal socialists. Anything that will distract from their own incompetence and responsibilities, usually proclamations of being a “Christian”, works.

This is a serious situation, it keeps Alabama corrupt and protects crooked politicians and elected officials. Alabama has dirty underwear.
