 The traffic problem is the result of the out of control growth in this area.   The kit of control growth is due because the local government is run by Catalyst.  Catalyst is financed by real estate developers.   Get the picture?
Next time the County Commission approves  150 house subdivision then this adds 300 cars to the roads, 300 kids in the local schools, and that much more sewage in the bay
Now do you see why out of control growth only benefits a few bits leaves the rest of us paying for this with more taxes, more traffic, and loss of life quality?   The developers will leave when they are done exploiting this area.
In the meantime they will attend church and say they are Conservative Christians while they rob us of our quality of life
