 You said nature culls the heard.  I said New Zealand didn't.  We weren't talking about favorite countries. Nearly all of the European union has dropped to double and single digits for new cases.  The US is heading towards 100,000.  Adjusted for population size and date of known infections, the US has 159 new infections per million. Canada 8, Switzerland 9, Belgium 7.5, Australia 5.4, Germany 4.36, Denmark 2.61, Netherlands 2.6, Ireland 1.8, South Korea 1.


This is why their countries are opening and will fare better than us.  My thoughts on Trump doesn't have anything to do with the economic damage done.  My point is, nature didn't have to "cull the herd".
