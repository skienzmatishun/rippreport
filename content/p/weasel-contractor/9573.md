 Let me get this straight.  A conservative can't have a dissenting opinion on 11 billion dollars spent on a wall.  A wall that will just be torn down by a liberal president in the future.  Sure would have been nice to spend that on some useful infrastructure like roads and fixing bridges.  But no, we go on our emotions and can't think about the future.  Like drugs are going to disappear with a wall.  Why not 11 billion to go after employers violating the law? Is America about deporting every dissenting view now? Is this a one party country?  Or maybe a one infallible person country?
