 This is a great example of the problem we face today.  Someone says they witness something.  For whatever reason, who knows?  Likely, these are the same words they use in person.  So someone else gets on Facebook and says my friend witnessed it!  Next, someone for whatever reason, says their friend witnessed it not even knowing the first person.  But if they said the truth, it would look bad.  So they don't know that "friend" personally.  Somewhere down the line, someone gets challenged.  To save face, they claim their friend is a nurse.  Now it's a "fact".
