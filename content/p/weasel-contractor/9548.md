 Fine.  Spew whatever you want.  Data on excess deaths not attributed to covid shows evidence that it's not likely.  But your anecdote is plenty of evidence for you. This conversation has become more about your emotions than saying anything relevant.  Why is it so hard to give me one source of information?  For anything?  I'm tired of the Republican party running on emotions rather than solutions.  I'm a conservative and I'm allowed to criticize my party.
