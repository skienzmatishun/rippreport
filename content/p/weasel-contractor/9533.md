 We know the hospitals overstate their Covid cases.   If you go in for a stubbed toe they will diagnose you as having Covid because they get more money
If you get run over by a truck then your cause of death is Covid
I have seen some medical people overstate Covid cases
Take your fearmongering and sell it to the sheep people
