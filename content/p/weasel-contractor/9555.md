 It sure is amazing how smart some people are in Lower Alabama. Smarter than doctors, nurses and health experts. Alabama is last, or next to last, in almost every category, except corruption. Political corruption is organized in Baldwin County. A small minority of loud and very vindictive people in Fairhope, make everything political. The city council wanted to take a chance on the Arts and Crafts show and have spoken out about how they do not believe in masks. If one of these people gets sick and goes to the hospital the first thing they are going to see is those silly masks on the Doctors and Nurses. Not wearing a mask identifies you.
