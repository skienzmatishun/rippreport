When Police Chiefs or Sheriff’s get wrapped up playing politics, sometimes it bites them in the ass. Just ask the former Police Chief of Fairhope, Bill Press. Maybe you could ask the current Fairhope Police Chief who, today, just announced his retirement after 36 years, Chief Joseph Pettis.

Two weeks ago Fairhope got a visit from the FBI, makes you wonder about the Police Chief retiring from the Catalyst stronghold! Catalyst is running scared and pulling every trick they can to gain votes for the June 5th primary.

Hoss Mack is supporting several Catalyst candidates:

Alabama has a proud legal system ripe with attorneys who plan a career as a judge. In Baldwin and Mobile Counties, there is a specified gateway to the sought-after bench. It is called an appointment.

Why would Hoss support Catalyst? That is an easy answer, because Chris Elliott will protect Hoss and keep the qualifications for Sheriff, in favor of Hoss. Boom Boom Pittman put them in place and Elliott will not change anything if he is elected.

The other candidates for State Senate Seat 32 have said they will introduce legislation that will be fair and match the states standard for Sheriff qualifications. If that happens Hoss is going to find it hard to get reelected after supporting Catalyst.
