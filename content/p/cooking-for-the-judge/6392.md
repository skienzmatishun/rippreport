 Dear Anonymous 
If you had to wait to run a DNA, take photos, and hack into their emails to prove these reports of impropriety, we would just be covered up with BP oil, good ‘ol boys get er done tactics, and everything in their world would continue be hunky dorey! People like you would continue to idolize them, they would continue to get rich off of politics, and EVERYBODY would be happy! 

But now we have technology, common sense and don’t have to pretend we don’t know or understand about their monkey business. And thanks to people like Ripp, who don’t give a flip about how uncomfortable he makes them feel, at least they know we know and it might keep them a little more honest. The world has become a little more transparent! And I love it!
