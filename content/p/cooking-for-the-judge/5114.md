 So Hoss Mack appeared at an event in apparent support for Bill Scully, and from that we are supposed to infer some kind of nefarious political conspiracy? 
How does Hoss supporting a candidate in another race amount to "involving the sheriff's office in any of the political races?" He wasn't in uniform, he wasn't on duty, and he wasn't using government resources. It should be obvious to any fair observer that he wasn't there in his official capacity as sheriff, but only in his personal capacity as a citizen. 
And what is your basis for stating that Catalyst approached Bob Wilters about running for DA, and not the other way around? Surely you don't claim to have been present, and you cite no statements by Wilters or anyone connected with Catalyst that would support what you state. If you want to speculate about people's motivations, go right ahead. But why not be honest about what is your speculation and what you can reliably report as fact? You do your readers a disservice when you don't distinguish between the two.
