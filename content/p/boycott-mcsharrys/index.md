The last edition of the Ripp Report we exposed, again, how the Fairhope City Council President and former councilman lied to the citizens of Fairhope.

This is nothing new. In fact it is quite common. Only this time it was publicly documented. Four of the council sat on the last council. They were the least productive, obstructive and corrupt of any council that has ever represented Fairhope.

{{< socialpreview url="https://rippreport.com/p/loser/" >}}

The Ripp Report is a Non-Profit Consumer Organization. The Ripp Report handles consumer issues, offers consultation on specific issues, family court issues and exposes political corruption. We cannot give legal advice, as we are not attorneys. We can however assist in finding competent attorneys. The intent of our non-profit is to inform the public on numerous issues, political and non political.

What they did with the council appointment was unethical and a deliberate effort on the council’s part to eliminate public participation. A federal lawsuit is evidence, and a precedent, to the council’s history of suppressing free speech and making a mockery of Public Participation.

{{< socialpreview url="https://rippreport.com/p/csb-railroad-nomination/" >}}

“Without any public participation the Fairhope City Council President, Jack Burrell, decided who would be the next councilperson and publicly declared that, I made the decision.”

This week the Fauxhope city attorney, Marcus McDowell represented Paula DiNardi in a case that was suppose to be an assault and intoxication charge against Ronan McSharry, owner of McSharry’s bar in Fairhope.

This has been a high profile case and another failure of the city attorney, city council and municipal judge. McSharry, already on probation, had help from the city attorney who, conveniently and repeatedly, failed to file the assault charge leaving McSharry with only having to face an intoxication charge in circuit court. The judicial hand off to a Judge that “wanted” the case.

Judge Stankowski, after a one day trial where McSharry was found guilty, rendering a sentence of one year, unsupervised probation, without addressing the assault charge or the fact McSharry had already been sentenced to 6 months in jail and was on probation at the time of the assault on DiNardi.

I was asked as a public observer in the court room, not a fact witness, to leave the court room.

I was not summons to court, however when the trial began and after opening statements, witnesses were asked to wait outside the courtroom to be called. That is when attorneys asked the Judge to expel me from the court as they “MAY” call me as a witness.

This was done to keep me out of the court room.

> Ala. R. Evid. 615
> 
> At the request of a party the court may order witnesses excluded so that they cannot hear the testimony of other witnesses and it may make the order of its own motion. This rule does not authorize exclusion of (1) a party who is a natural person, (2) an officer or employee of a party which is not a natural person designated as its representative by its attorney, (3) a person whose presence is shown by a party to be essential to the presentation of the party's cause, or (4) a victim of a criminal offense or the representative of a victim who is unable to attend, when the representative has been selected by the victim, the victim's guardian, or the victim's family.

I am an advocate for Paula DiNardi so why would McDowell not want me there?

I would have made an excellent witness against McSharry.

I could have explained the last drunken incident where McSharry was found guilty, and the two before that

Mr. McSharry has a history of alcohol related incidents that have resulted in assaults on women.

Why has this been ignored?

How does a green card holder maintain a liquor license, in Fairhope, with a history of alcohol related crimes?

How does a Mayor and council turn a blind eye to women being assaulted in a public place?

It helps if council president Burrell is your best friend.

Judge STANKY;

“And at the center of it will be a guy who really shouldn’t be on the bench. Any judge willing to use his power to manipulate things for his friends should be booted. If you voted for Stanky, I’d urge you to pay close attention to him for the next couple of years. If you’re someone with integrity, who understands and cares about the law and won’t be a good ol’ boy backwater judge, consider running. Baldwin deserves better.”

This is the good ole boys, CSB, doing what ever the hell they want to do.

It is a perfect example of judicial corruption and the stranglehold Catalyst/Scott Boone consulting and their associates have over Baldwin County. The judges and city attorney could give a damn, they know that judicial corruption in Alabama is never investigated because the entire system is corrupt.

It is about political power, control limiting or eliminating any public participation and how to maintain the status quo.

{{< socialpreview url="https://rippreport.com/p/quarterback-sneak/" >}}

Judges in Alabama are subject to 7 Canons of Judicial Ethics. Number 2. “A judge should avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in ALL his activities.”

How clear is that? “appearance of impropriety”.

{{< socialpreview url="https://rippreport.com/p/judicial-trick/" >}}

Baldwin County has had a reputation of judicial malfeasance, trickery and out right corruption. Citizens read about it in Lagniappe or on line however nothing changes.

Some Judges and lawyers feel insulated from any accountability, they are shielded by an inept system that abuses it’s citizens. Ethics laws are designed to PROTECT the very elected and appointed officials that use their positions, to their advantage/

{{< socialpreview url="https://rippreport.com/p/women-stand-together/" >}}

To be victimized by the City Of Fairhope is like being hit twice. The city council didn’t stand up & say "this is wrong", or "I’m sorry this has happened to you"…but the mayor did. Then she was crucified for having a compassionate heart & calling them out for their unlawful & unethical behavior.

{{< socialpreview url="https://rippreport.com/p/watering-hole/" >}}

McSharry’s was the watering hole for Judges, Attorneys and of course McSharry’s best friend, Council President Jack Burrell, who was honored with a sandwich on the menu named after him. Jack also has a police report that he never disclosed prior to the last election.

{{< socialpreview url="https://rippreport.com/p/one-woman-2/" >}}

Ronan McSharry was found guilty In Fairhope Municipal Court, this last week, of public intoxication and assault, sentenced to 180 days in jail, with time served during his re-hab stay.

McSharry was represented by Defense attorney John Beck, well known for victimizing the victims.

You can be sure an appeal will follow. McSharry does not want to go to jail.

The drama is far from over, a civil case and many legal issues have yet to be addressed. Tuesday March 22 will be the next day in court.

Presiding Judge Stankoski, should recuse himself from any further action involving McSharry.

## WHERE IS THE OUTRAGE?

How can a woman in a public place be assaulted, on video, end up suffering such humiliation, without any public outcry?

Where are the women’s clubs?

Where are the Republican Women of Baldwin County?

Where are the citizens of Fairhope, the Christians?

Where are the warm and fuzzy magazines that promote “embracing development”?

The Mayor has been silent and the council complicit, allowing the corrupt judiciary to wash their dirty laundry.

Fairhope citizens should be ashamed this is happening in their community and there lack of compassion and action will be an incentive for future corruption.

## BOYCOTT McSHARRY’S

Lagniappe has covered this story from the beginning. I encourage you to read their many articles.
