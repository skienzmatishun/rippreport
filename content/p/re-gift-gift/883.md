 The good ole boys (entire council) recruited well before the last election. They just figured they would be able to rig it like usual...they just needed placeholders...warm bodies to run. Ripp upturned the apple cart when he brought the AG's legal counsel to oversee the election. This resulted in Kant's defeat and the election of many of the new council that Ripp backed unknowingly.  Now we can plainly see that there is much work to be done.

One more legitimate election and we will have our city back.

Ladies it is time.  We must start recruiting candidates.

Fairhope is not ruined yet.  We can reclaim it from the GOB network. There are too many young families banking on it.

Join forces against the evil of the GOB Network.  The one Burrell says does not exist.
