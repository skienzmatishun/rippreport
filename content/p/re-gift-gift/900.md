 When the apartments go in Then the sewer plant will overflow more.   Then the citizens will have to pay for another plant.   We already are paying three times the taxes than we were fifteen years ago.   
When will the people see that this cancerous and out of control growth costs us the citizens and only the developers, real estate people, and politicians benefit.   When this is over, the politicians get our taxes and the real estate people and developers move on to another place to pillage.
