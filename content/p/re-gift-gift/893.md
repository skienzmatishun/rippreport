 Why do you say that? I think he and the other new councilmen are doing pretty good considering they have only been in office 6 months. Seems to me Robinson does a great job of explaining the way he votes doing research with the Alabama League of Municipalities, I appreciate the prep work and research. He didn't even vote with Burrell on some issues at the council meeting I attended. He and Conyers always seem to express their concerns respectfully.
