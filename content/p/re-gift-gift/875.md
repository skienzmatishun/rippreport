 Criminals. All of the good ole boys have been exposed. You cannot spin this. They were caught. The city attorney and clerk said nothing and went along? Maybe this explains why the city attorney talked to the mayor like she was his pet dog? Those five councilmen are working for Corte. If you can't see it you're stupid. The city attorney is too. I don't know about the city clerk but how does this get by everyone without a peep to the new mayor? Why the two sets of documents? 

Fairhope is beyond a joke. It is a criminal enterprise.
