 I was deemed by the Judge to be a public figure in the lawsuit against Fairhope Times, I won that lawsuit, last year. The bar association recognized me as a reporter and refused to discuss complaints against Attorneys.The Ripp Report is a non profit consumer group exposing corruption in the most corrupt state in the U S and the most corrupt county in Alabama. Fairhope was the most corrupt municipality in the county, no more because Timmy is gone. ha ha chew on that.
