 "She has harmed more people and divided our community more than anyone in our cityâ€™s history."  This is typical of so much of what Jester posts and why no one puts any credence in anything he spews.  Jester, you cannot make a personal opinion truth, much as you would like to.  Maybe folks would pay more attention to you if you didn't consistently put forth personal opinions to try and make others think something that is false.  You are a poor writer and a worse debater and that why I can only read the first couple of sentences of everything you write because the rest is going to be all about what you think instead of reality.  And frankly, I think most of us are pretty sick and tired of listening to what you think.
