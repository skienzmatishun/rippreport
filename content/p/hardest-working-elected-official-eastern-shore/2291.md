 I want to thank the killer B's (Burell, Boone, and Brown) and the J's squared (Jay and Jimmy) for keeping this city together as the Queen tries to destroyed what Kant, Boone, and Burell and others helped build. The council has stood firm when the Queen threatened to sue US and the council. I love the article about the IT technician, he is standing his ground. I wonder how many invoices the Queen has changed or has altered? If you trying to hide one you will hide others!
I was at a meeting today in Mobile, the Governor was there, I had a side bar with one of the professors - she made this statement "I have heard about your mayor, ya'll have your hands full, is crazy or what?" That was her direct quote. 
So sad for Fairhope!
