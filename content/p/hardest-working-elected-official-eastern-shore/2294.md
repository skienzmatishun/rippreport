 Article today out of GCN is clear evidence of witness tampering by the Mayor. She is clearly trying to silence Tanner.  He has the goods on her and she got her lapdog lawyer to fire off a baseless threatening letter.  She is too stupid to realize the Council has to authorize legal action on behalf of the city.  That will never happen.  Not to mention Tanner did not breach any agreement or disclose anything.  Tanner ... tell it baby.  Lay the cards on the table and call the mayor's BS bluff.  She needs to go down and in cuffs if necessary.
