 The greatest incentive for people to annex into the city of Fairhope is for the Mayor Wilson to resign then maybe some would annex! Did everyone watch the babbling fool try and explain something at the council meeting? Uh, and, giggle, uh, well, citiZens, well, uh oh, giggle, giggle, then she lied then lied more! "we do not have the budget for the police to take care of the city"...so let us pull back and lose the $1.5M then see what the budget the police looks like! Is she really that stupid!
