 Here is how that award is given - first anyone can nominate someone, then when they select individuals that have been nominated in an anonymous vote, then they are awarded based on people voting, but, you can vote multiple times as in every 2 - 3 hours. In other words, if you have 25 people nominate someone, and then there are 3 or 4 people selected for the nominations, then if you have 25 - 50 people vote every 2 - 3 hours, well, you win! This mayor is the most self-serving, full of crap person around. On her Facebook page, she posted an article that was bought and paid for, if you fall for her lies then shame on you! All those votes were NOT a cumulative for the mayor! I put whiskey in the punch bowl so we all could have fun!!!!
