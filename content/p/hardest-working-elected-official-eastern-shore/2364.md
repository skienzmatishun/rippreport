 The Mayor did a great job, I agree.  I just looked up D&amp;J Enterprises, the company that was awarded the contract.  Its primary business is disaster recovery, which makes it infinitely more qualified to perform the work.  Why did Jack Burrell have such a hissy fit?  I have seldom seen such a public temper tantrum for no good reason!  
Hopefully, there will be no disaster from which to recover, but I feel that we are in better hands than when Pittman handled the last mess.
