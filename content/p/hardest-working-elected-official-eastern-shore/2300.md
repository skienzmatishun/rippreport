 JESTER, I still have the veterans crisis hotline since you seem to need it. Must be off your meds or you haven't called yet. It's very important that you call since you seem to have put other people in harms way besides yourself. And if you are not a veteran you are certainly a disgrace to the entire human race with all that talk about wing man and all the missions you said you have flown. You are sick Jester and we want to help. If you take yourself out without letting us help you. Well, we are trying to contact you. Even you have admitted that you need help. Please let us help you. Will not cost you a penny!  We will even come get you.
