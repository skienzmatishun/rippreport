 Paul, you have deleted posts before! Your May 12th - "How the Pendulum Swings" edition. There were posts about the mayor getting helicopter rides for herself and a family member. You deleted several posts from that edition comment section. There is a post to defend this questionable action, May 14, 2017, 10:51 AM. 
Sorry, but I have all the post of the editions where I post a comment and I use to post anonymously then went my current handle in June. Now you know why I had to choose to capture the posts on all editions where I have posted. 
So, yes, you or another administrator of the site have deleted posts before. Did not really want to call you out on this but you seem to want to try and tie me to certain posts. This goes to your intent and you have deleted post(s) [emphasis added] before!
PLEASE, please do not play me for a fool.
