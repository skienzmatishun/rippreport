 That was not the issue in that case if he had filed a counter claim asking the judge if you were a public figure. The judge stated that since that was not part of the suit, so he ruled in your favor over the Times. The Times used that as part of their defense but did not file a counter claim. That is why the Times paid you $500 and move on. If you have been claimed a public figure then the door would be open on you, folk can say what they want about you. But the Judge said he would have named you a public figure if he could have ruled but that was not at issue. If you are a public figure anyone can say anything they choose about you. But you have not been named a public figure, yet. The Alabama Bar can say what they want, it is what a judge stated that matters. If you are a reported then you need to report and stop being a political arm for the mayor. Roger thought he was a reporter too, but a judge ruled he was a blogger and we saw how that ended. Alabama Department of Revenue and the IRS may want to look at the political activities on this site??? You are a blogger! Now, ha ha chew on that!
