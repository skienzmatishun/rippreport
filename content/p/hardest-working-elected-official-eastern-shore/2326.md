 I wondered if that was true (the same person posting under various names).  And it does make sense.  When people feel their opinion (about anything) is in the minority they tend to want to  inflate their position by posting numerous times as different people, and by using phrases like "everyone I talk to thinks...", "residents all know that..." and other completely false statements.  This is a noticeable trait of Jester and others who post here routinely.
