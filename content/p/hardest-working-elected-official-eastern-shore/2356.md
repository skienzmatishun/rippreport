 IF we need D&amp;J Enterprises and let's all pray we won't, they will be worried more about the tornadoes in Auburn that getting down to Fairhope. What should have been looked at this company's other contracts they have with different cities, then we would see just low of priority Fairhope will be if we need them. At Least Pittman lives here, and he is local and would care about getting us back in our homes because he knows most of us. But as with most issues, this mayor is making change for the sake of change. She is dumb, foolish and is slowly destroying the city. If she had not bid out the contracts the current contract will remain in place and it was cheaper. Type in these letters I.D.I.O.T. and look at the picture, it is our mayor! Smoke em' if you have them!
