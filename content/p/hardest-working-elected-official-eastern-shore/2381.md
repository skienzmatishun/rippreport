 The mayor needs to spend more time preparing her responses. Jack accused her of not wanting to award Pittman the contract, and that's absolutely the truth, she didn't. Nothing wrong with that reasoning due to Pittman's substandard past work for the city. Most people in the city didn't want to see Pittman awarded the contract either. Wilson should have had her facts together and that would have ended any further discussion. Instead, she rambled on about creating opportunities for others. I'm with her on rebidding the contract, but sheesh, she doesn't communicate her position very well at all.
