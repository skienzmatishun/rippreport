 I have no idea of the facts here, but I have read Gulf Coast News Todays' report and I have to say that Tanner Bonner sounds illiterate.  I don't know if he has been misquoted or if he is truly as stupid and uneducated as his comments appear.  It is not his opinion that matters, only the facts, and he can't even put together a coherent sentence.  Is he 20 and on drugs?  Also, the letter came from the Fairhope City attorney, NOT an attorney for the Mayor so he should at least get his own facts straight.  Pitiful!
