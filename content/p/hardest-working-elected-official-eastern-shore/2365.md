 I guess my comment got deleted AGAIN...So if someone is "nice" they don't commit fraud?  Wrong.  I saw the membership rosters with my own eyes.  One year even listed all 5 of "their" children. Being local business owners themselves makes it even worse.  It's only come out because she is now Mayor, and has accused everyone else of corruption and misdeeds.  I hope it's being investigated to the fullest.
