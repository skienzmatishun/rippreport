 I guess when there is all this bad news, any good bits helps. This not a featured article and maybe now she will stop saying the media is bias. She has to be the hardest working politician on the Eastern Shore, she has harmed more people and divided our community more than anyone in our city's history. So she gets mentioned, and it was at the bottom of the article. How many featured stories have been negative for Fairhope, almost of them. Ripp grabs anything that can possibly show something good, but there is another story published today, and once again it has caught our fair Queen in a lie. I can not wait to see how Ripp and the Queen try to spend the other article! Oppps!
