 Jester. You stated seeing combat and holding at certain levels and your military service was immoral and getting to you. Why don't you let the Veterans Administration help. You are certainly a sick person and you talk as you have no problem with taking your own life. I'll stay away from that one. You should at least for your family and friends? Get some help. There is no doubt that you need it. And you seem to shy away from the idea of getting some help. Why??? Can't say you don't. And anybody that thinks you don't should check into what the harbor at Thomas Hospital can offer them.
