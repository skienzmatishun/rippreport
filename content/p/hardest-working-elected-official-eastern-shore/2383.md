 She doesn't; she needs better educated and informed advisors.  Her heart is in the right place but it appears that her staff is clueless and they don't know how to prepare her.  The Mayor did a great job, however, getting this contract bid out and having it awarded to a professional disaster recovery company.  I agree with those who believe that Burrell behaved like a toddler having a tantrum.  Pittman has made politics his career, so Fairhope is far better served by having someone else in charge of a dreaded disaster.  Why does Burrell care so much? Didn't Karin state that Pittman didn't even throw in a bid?  I am confused.
