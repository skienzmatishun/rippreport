 I thought the work session and city council went well. I was not thrilled with Jack's reaction to the Pittman contract but I'm sure I've acted like that before so I can't fault him. A better way to look at that reaction is he is passionate about things he believes in. I can relate. We all have to tone it down. 
 Thanks for handling the 3 foot monster gator in the duck pond. A toddler could get hurt and I'm sure that is not something anyone would want to happen.  Sherry lea is going to work on a city sweeper rotation schedule to be posted on website and if there is standing water by your house call the public works office. 
A good night at city council 
I didn't see any juggling, jingling or dancing. 
I believe your triple 6 is a "SQUAD" ( as my boys would say).
