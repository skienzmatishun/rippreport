The Fairhope City Council has bullied the Mayor at Council meetings and other public venues. The first council meetings of this council’s term, were disgraceful. The “leadership” of the bulling was headed by Council President Jack Burrell, who refuses to share the Council President chair, and is supported by Councilmen Boone and Brown. Councilmen Conyers and Robinson were mute, but complicit.

Bulling, intimidation, and victimization are one in the same. Intimidation is a major weapon in the Baldwin County political and judicial arena and some “men” find women an easy target.

Women need to speak up more.

## BARSTOOL

### BARSTOOL | THE RIPP REPORT / BALDWIN COUNTY LEGAL EAGLE

![](https://cdn.rippreport.com/barstool.jpg)

Corruption has many faces. In Fairhope the local arrest of a bar owner, Ronan McSharry, drew little more than a paragraph of coverage and little or no print media has covered the story. FAIRHOPE, Ala.

The VICTIM, Paula DiNardi, in this case had to endure several postponements of the case and over 8 hours in the Fairhope Municipal Court, only to be victimized again. Paula was the latest victim of McSharry and has had her life turned upside down since the incident.

Paula has for the most part has stood alone in her attempt for justice. The City Attorney has represented her poorly and the defense attorney wants to politicize an assault case into a continued witch hunt against the Mayor.

Ronan McSharry was found guilty In Fairhope Municipal Court, this last week, of public intoxication and assault, sentenced to 180 days in jail, with time served during his re-hab stay. McSharry was represented by Defense attorney John Beck, well known for victimizing the victims. You can be sure an appeal will follow. McSharry does not want to go to jail.

Mr. McSharry, through another attorney attempted to “settle the issue” with DiNardi, providing she remain silent for life and not show up for court, thus the charges would be dropped. It is the Ripp Report’s understanding both offers were rejected. Her reason for not taking the money and running is quite simple. She feels that women should not be beat up by men, and then paid off to remain silent.

Mr Beck not only defended McSharry but he wandered into a line of questioning that politicized, and was not relevant, to the assault and public intoxication case. Mr Beck has a way of victimizing the victim and making the guilty party look innocent.

## DA continues pursuit of Spanish Fort rape case - Lagniappe Mobile

### DA continues pursuit of Spanish Fort rape case - Lagniappe Mobile

The Baldwin County District Attorney’s office has no plans to drop charges against 18-year-old Cameron Harrison, the Spanish Fort High School (SFHS) student accused of raping an unconscious 16-year-old female at an open house party in Timber Creek last month. Harrison’s attorney John Beck claims the defendant is falsely accused. Beck said the district attorney’s …

Note: Archive of original source.

Paula was represented, in court, by the City Attorney Marcus McDowell, who job it is, to vigorously, represent the victim. However Mr. McDowell neither objected or interfered with Mr. Beck’s line of questioning which had no relevant value to the case.

The Municipal Judge allowed Mr Beck to go unchallenged. Beck asked DiNardi a series of questions related to me, Paul Ripp aka Ripp Report. and my involvement in the case. She explained that the Ripp Report, a non profit consumer organization, was acting as an advocate for her. Why the judge nor the city attorney did not ask, Mr Beck, what relevance it had to do with the case, I do not know.

Then Mr Beck asked a series of questions about the Mayor, and her alleged involvement, in the case or her connection to Paul Ripp, The Ripp Report. Beck just rambled on without any objection being heard.

It appears that the politicization of the case will be Mr. Beck’s defense, supported by victimization of the victim.

The City Attorney did not even mention the medical damages, over 6000.00 dollars, that DiNardi has incurred, nor did he mention that Mr. McSharry has a green card and is not a citizen of the U.S. WHY?

DiNardi not only finds her life turned upside down but now has come to the realization that her case is being used in an ongoing political witch hunt, focused on defeating Mayor Wilson in 2020.

The Mayor and the Ripp Report are not relevant to the criminal charges against McSharry.

Get ready folks for 2020 because this is all about politics and politicians, Judges and Attorney’s keeping their jobs. By the way McSharry’s has a J Burrell sandwich on the menu. J Burrell is also the Council President that secured the City Attorney his job as well as the Municipal Judge, it is all connected folks.

Since Mr Beck appears to be ignorant about what the Ripp Report is all about we will be sure to sign him up for the newsletter. In the meantime here are two articles that Mr. Beck may find helpful.
