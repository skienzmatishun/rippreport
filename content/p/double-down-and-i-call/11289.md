 It’s irritating to see a city council member, dressed in “regular” clothes at Walgreens at 5:50 pm on the night of a city council meeting. He did not show up for the work session or the city council meeting.  How hard is it to schedule a years worth of city council meetings? Especially, when your getting paid and free insurance! Hope there’s a reason!  FAIRHOPE!!
