 By the way Jackson Oak, forty years ago
Your neighborhood was a trailer park.  Did you know that?   Gentrification is great.   It runs off the local riff raft, brings in higher incomes, and higher taxes that we can charge you.   You are nothing but a tax farm
Daphne has always been a bunch of people just waiting to be taxed and governed.    So how much did your taxes go up this year?   You call it taxes but it is actually RENT to us
Bwahhh haaaa haaa
