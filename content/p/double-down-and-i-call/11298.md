 Dear Dorothy,
We might be “low lifes” but we still own this place.   This is our world and you are just in it.   Welcome to OUR world.  By the way, those higher taxes  allow us to hire supporters in county positions  for our agenda so that we can perpetuate our goals
Thank you for your financial support
