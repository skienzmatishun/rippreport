 I question at times the use of recusals.   My Open Records suit cost me $15K, with two recusals in district court, and subsequently my attorney fired me after three years WITHOUT cause or satisfaction. I am interested in the outcome of your writ for my knowledge in filing one in circuit court for open records as per say. Would you share with me your public documents, including the court flow chart,  shown during your last podcast the day before your hearing?  Thanks.  At 72, I am still determined to fight for my rights, just a little slower these days.
