The Ripp Report is a consumer organization first. We also maintain a blog site, Facebook pages and a Podcast production. The Ripp Report is a not for profit. We expose political corruption and file appropriate complaints.

On Monday the 25th of November, Judge Johnny Hardwick, Circuit Judge, Montgomery County, will hear a STATUS REVIEW on all pending motions, relative to the Writ of Mandamus, I, Francis Paul Ripp, filed October 18th.

{{< socialpreview url="https://rippreport.com/p/this-is-a-test/" >}}

UPDATE: Judge Johnny Hardwick, Montgomery Circuit Judge, explained that he had been selected by the Chief Justice Tom Parker to preside over some ethics cases on November 1st. He explained that he read the evidence to my Writ of Mandamus and found it very interesting and wished he could delve into the case. The Judge however decided to recuse himself from hearing our case, due to a potential conflict of interest.

Attorney Harry Still and myself had no problem with the Judge hearing the case, however, we respect his decision and will wait until the case is rescheduled.

A civil case will be filed against Regions Bank, which will involve the trustees of the Mabel Amos Memorial Fund, in the near future. The Mabel Amos Memorial Fund is private money and the allegations we have leveled against Mr. Albritton are based on his “self Dealing” of said trust, as a trustee.

Mr Albritton is the Executive Director of the Ethics Commission. His actions as a trustee, which he has admitted to in Lagniappe articles, should require him to resign from the Ethics Commission, immediately.

Stay tuned, this story is far from over. The civil case will expose just how many of Mr. Albritton’s law partners and friends were on the “self serving”, money train.
