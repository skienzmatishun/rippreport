 Julie Von L. If you really found that the post were the most interesting part of this site and you think it was the Mayor's page. You are first, a little off and second, post that agree or disagree with the Mayor have both always been and I'm sure will continued to be posted. If you really enjoyed the post most of all then you should be ashamed for even saying that. I truly hope this is not your real name because you will be know as a person who enjoys people making horrible accusations, calling people horrific names and enjoy reading what fools of Fairhope have on their mind at the time they post which about 95% has nothing to do with the subject of the current article. Go rent some old Richard Pryor or Eddie Murphy live comic dvd's. This will keeping you occupied and they will have some of the same wording as a great number of previous post has had. There funny and Raw. That's what you like. Farewell Julie!!! Enjoy
