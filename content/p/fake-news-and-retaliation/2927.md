 When the old guard is ousted there is always push back. As far as I can see, Kant is out, and yet life in Fairhope goes on. The town did not screech to a halt. The sky didn't go dark. And the shops didn't close. I'm sure this is dismaying to those who, for whatever reason, hate Mayor Wilson. 
Frankly, all I cared about was that the expansion of Fairhope slow to a manageable rate. Kant was handing out permits like trading cards. And our infrastructure simply cannot accommodate the massive influx of new residents. 
And that's the laughy part. Permits were granted. New homes and neighborhoods were built. New people moved in. And none of them cared how long Kant had been in office or who was friends with. In fact, they had any reason to support him at all. Moreover, these new people began to notice that the quaint little town they fell in love with was turning into a small city, complete with traffic jams and parking problems. How long before crime was on the rise? They weren't willing to find out. 
So out with the old and in with the new.
