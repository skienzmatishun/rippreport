 There is one main reason people can't get along.  It's because one person says something...llet's say "The sun is shining."  Many people will agree with this statement but some for reasons only they understand will choose to interpret those words in an unintended and usually negative manner.  "I actually saw some clouds so, not really that sunny." "Hate the sun, too hot."  "It's summer stupid, what do you expect?!"    And so on.  It's as though we've completely lost the ability to discuss anything without   offense.
