 I can tell you this. Day or Night. You seldom saw Kant without Fidler right by his side. Hummmm?  Oh well. They are both gone. The more Fiddler pushes back against the Mayor. The more the citizens of Fairhope are going to realize is the only mistake that the Mayor made (concerning Fidler) was not firing her the first day. That goes for the other 2 as well. Other mistakes have been made by the Mayor. But this is one that should have been avoided to begin with!  The Mayor I think was actually trying to give them a chance. Big mistake. Ask Fidler how many times she had talked to Jack Burrell since the Mayor took office. Fidler was negative before she got fired.  Ask her!!
