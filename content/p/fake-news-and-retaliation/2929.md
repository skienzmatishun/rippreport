 This entire post is just the pot calling the kettle black. The rude picture says it all. One sided news? Name calling? That's your specialty with this new mayor. And I get that jester and truth got off topic. And they were a bit tedious at times. But you know what I did? Skipped right past their posts. (Although I did see some facts in their posts) All the fuss was exactly what they wanted.and y'all played right into it. And now they are banned. The same way the mayor blocks folks. It's too bad, we are now living in a town divided.
