 "These three women worked for Tim Kant and did whatever he told them, right or wrong. If he told them to jump off a cliff they would hold hands and jump together. They however turned on the newly elected Mayor and did everything they could to undermine and obstruct her, until they got fired. You had better believe Mr Kant has provoked the three to continue to file lawsuits, alleged assaults and keep the rumors going."
What evidence do you have to substantiate this?
