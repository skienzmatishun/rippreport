 I agree 100% and want to help. I just got back from Winn Dixie and I made sure that I bought enough tissues for all those who will be missing the Jesters and the Truth Teller posts. Especially those of you who cannot read and must not have much of an education. Those of you who are saying that this posting site is being censored has got to be BIG fans of Jester Triple-Six and Truth Teller and I'm sorry that you are mad and upset. I bought plenty of tissues for you to have too. I need a few myself for the tears that I'm shedding that there are people out there who would follow such heathens with support and outrage simply for those who cannot read or understand what this article is about.   The Mayor haters I have plenty of tissues for you. Even though y'all are fighting and complaining about censorship I tear up that you still don't know what this article is about. Sniff. Sniff. Nobody said you cannot say anything negative about anything. One lesson that I have learned today is that if you are Jester or Truth Teller or don't like the Mayor or support these people. I'm ashamed that you cannot handle this in a more positive way.  Just because your heroes were knock out of the jerk and misfit games they were playing certainly makes me feel that we are working with a bunch of immature individuals. Get real. Get involved and express your opinion. Those a hole are gone. RIP (rest in peace)
