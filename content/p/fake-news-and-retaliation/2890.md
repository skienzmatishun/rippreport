 Good riddens and may you never comeback. You have no respect for anybody if you truly found the comments the most interesting part of the story. It was becoming a shooting range for what ever topic the poster was thinking that day and not regarding the subject at hand. You pretend to know what the answer is and that the Mayor had something to do with it. Well, You know you are wrong and the fact the Mayor or anybody was attacked every week is the subject of this article and sticking to the subject. This is not the posting site for the Mayor and she does not control what is ot what is not posted. It's people like you that reminds us so quickly of the people who can't stay on subject so we bid farewell to you and hope you keep your promise of "So long and Farewell!" Bye!  We have lots of work to do and we need to do it by working together just like this article is saying and without all the unnecessary name calling and accusations. No matter who you are for. Be a grownup and work hard to help what or who you think is doing a good job for Fairhope and is right for Fairhope. Doesn't matter who. Just be civil about it. Again. So long!
