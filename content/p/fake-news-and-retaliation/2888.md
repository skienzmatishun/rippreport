 Julie, I don't think you read Mr. Ripp's post.  All comments that disagree with others' opinions are not being deleted...you, like Jester, are making accusations that are false.    But even you - who are obviously anti-Mayor (and that's fine, not the issue at all) - must agree that responsible, adult discourse is the way to go about any issue or topic, political or otherwise.  Jester was incapable of providing anything worthwhile and insisted instead on attacking the Mayor and her administration for things they are not responsible for and accusations which were personal instead of factual, such as calling SherryLea "Botox", etc. I for one out-grew grade school many years ago and have no patience of grownups who haven't.
