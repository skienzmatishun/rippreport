 Fairhope has lost its charm because it literally stinks!   Forget who likes/ dislikes the Mayor.  Kant and his Council have been betting for MANY years that they would not be caught in this massive fraud of stealing tax dollars for their 'friends'.  Now it is time to settle up.  If everyone in Fairhope does not show up to the next Council meeting, it will prove to the Kant, Boone &amp; Burrell that we don't care HOW much sewage they dump into our Bay.  Why is everyone afraid of them?
Wilson also has mistakes to take care of.....could they all please  broker a deal so that Fairhope can move on?  
There is no doubt that momentum is on Wilson's side;  our former Mayor and Council(s) have led us to this massive stink!
