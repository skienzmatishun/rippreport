 Get with the program Henry G.  Say what you want to say. Good or bad about the Mayor or Jack Burrell or one of the other councilmen. It will get posted. Just make sure it shows some character. Nothing is being censored except ridiculous and pathetic name calling or just crap. Hope your feelings are not hurt for something that you misunderstood. Let's just get this out right now!!! NOT CENSORSHIP TOWARDS SAYING SOMETHING GOOD OR BAD OR FOR BEING FOR OR AGAINST SOMEONE OR SOMETHING. Just plain simple manners and respect of all people that you would like to post about. Damn. You can hate someone with good taste and get posted. This is not a one side posting!!!!  Just trying to take out the rudeness and the dumbass out of it so that the intelligent people can enjoy reading the posts!!!
