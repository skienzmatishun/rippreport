 Thank you so much, Mr. Ripp! I know it will be difficult to keep Jester from posting anonymously, but I do appreciate the effort and the reasons for it.  Secondly, regarding Gulf Coast Media, it's about time somebody called those fools out.  It's shameful that any "news source" could show such bias and still have people follow their propaganda.  An hour after anything happens within the City that they felt they could slant to hurt the Mayor, it was on Facebook.  By the same token, not once did I ever see anything positive that the Mayor said, did, or accomplish being covered in their stupid pages.  My God, wouldn't you think that just for the APPEARANCE of being unbiased they'd make the tiniest effort to be fair?
