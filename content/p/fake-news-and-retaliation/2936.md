 Fairhope...the crappy corrupt, little town on the bay. So boone and burrell and the last council and kant paid 12 million dollars (U.S.) for the sewer "up grade". This upgrade resulted in normal fecal discharges into Mobile Bay. How can this be in beautiful lovely Fairhope?

Silly Fairhope is right.

Earth to Fairhope:

Please wake up about your thieving pols. And the fact Mobile Bay is your terlet.
