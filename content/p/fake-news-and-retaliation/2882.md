 I am clearly way out of the loop b/c I missed all of this about the Courier interviewing the Jester; however, my guess for Jester would be Jack Burrell; I have met Robert Brown several times and I don't see any similiarity between the two.....Burrell......definitely! 
Also, is this a joke about Kant planning a run for public office?  Forgetting his age, let's take a look at the legacy that he left behind.  Our flowers smell wonderful but his errors and omissions as Fairhope's Mayor (and also picking up a salary as CEO of Fairhope Utilities)  will tarnish his name long after he is dead.  If the Fly Creek Apartments eventually get a permit to build, Fairhope is toast.  Just look at what a moderate amount of rain (in our area) did to Point Clear last week.   Kant was bought and paid for by Corte, who paid big bucks (IMHO to Burrell &amp; Boone also, but they could just be stupid).
There are definitely a lot of people who miss Fidler &amp; Sullivan; I am not one of them.  I have never met Sullivan but I did have several interactions with Fidler.  She was the Queen of Fairhope and her final word was law.  I have mixed feelings about her absence because she did a lot of great things for our City; however, as an individual property owner, I believe that she abused her office to the max.
