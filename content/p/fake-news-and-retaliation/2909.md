 Last post - I think people are upset is because Fairhope is still a small, family oriented town where people care about each other or at least they did. I wish the Mayor well and hope for the best but our little town has lost its charm, not because of growth but because of social media. Instead of people talking to each other to solve problems, they talk to social media and post. I personally think the Ripp Report has become part of the issues around town. You can not post, become the censor, the prosecutor, the judge, and the jury. Paul is supposed to report the facts, but as with all media, the facts are not always facts. Sorry, it is time for me to retire.
