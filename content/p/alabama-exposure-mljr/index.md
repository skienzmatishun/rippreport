A short but powerful read from Alabama Exposure and Accountability. The Framing of Murray Lawrence Sr.  

If this story appeared in a novel, readers would reject it as implausible. They would insist no justice system could allow failures this extensive across law enforcement, prosecutors, defense counsel, the courts and the prison system.

But this is not fiction.

Every part of this story is grounded in documented fact.

After reading it, Fairhope, Baldwin County and the State of Alabama will never look the same.
