The Ripp Report recently changed it’s business status from a tax deductible non profit to a corporation. It is still a non profit, without any federal tax deductibility. This also allows the Ripp Report/Baldwin County Legal Eagle to become more engaged in the election process by sponsoring or contributing to specific candidates.

One thing you can say about the Alabama Ethics Commission is that they are shamelessly predictable.

To dismiss a complaint and not answer any questions nor offer any explanation as to the allegations, is a whitewash of facts.

The Ethics Commission is suppose to be looking out for the citizens of the state. Instead we have a faux organization that protects the connected and convicts the weak. They have become the Unethical Commission.

By Josh Moon Alabama Political Reporter The Alabama Ethics Commission has become a joke. Let’s all stop pretending that this five-man panel, along with its Executive Director and legal counsel, are any sort of a defense against corrupt public servants or a means to punish public corruption. They’re not. Not consistently. And not without an Read More

JOB WITH BENEFITS & NO ACCOUNTABILITY

The Fairhope City Council President, for the last 5 years?, is truly a shining example of what you do not need in a council president. The Council was approached by the Mayor to mediate their differences, by using an attorney that would represent the Mayor, the request was for 15,000 dollars. Council president Burrell said it was not necessary and that he was the mediator. Eight weeks have passed and Burrell has mediated nothing.

Mr. Burrell did however get the Airport Authority to cover his attorney fees relative to the Ethics complaint.

The City budget was presented by the Mayor 4 weeks ago and council has yet to meet with the Mayor to discuss it. They want to pass their responsibility to a newly appointed finance committee.

Most recently Mr Burrell is defending the Fairhope sewer system saying the infrastructure problems “are blown out of proportion” and “sewer spills can’t be prevented”. He cannot explain why Fairhope spent 13 million on a sewer plant and not spent no money on sewer infrastructure! He also has no answers about why, while he was council president, the city utilities transferred 10 million to the general fund for non utility expenses.
