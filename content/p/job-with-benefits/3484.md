 I would like to point out that it starts at the top. There two persons that are both perfect role models for this "Jobs with Benefits" blog. These are two fine examples of doing nothing  but receiving all the benefits (and more) as individuals while each being our president for 8 years!!! One couldn't even run a baseball team and lied to get us into a war and the other one took us 20 years backwards and put a lot of us out of business (some) or out of work with some kind of health care bull crap as well as ordered the troops into Africa and now they are both bitching and  complaining NOW? Both are responsible for losing lives that they both could have prevented.  Why are they complaining NOW???   Did I miss the memo about both of them being great leaders?  I know!  Can you believe it!  Both were elected twice!!! We don't have to put up with this here in our own City of Fairhope!  The air is clear and so are the evils being done by Jack Burrell and his merry men.  This too will unravel so that we will prosper along side someone else's leadership that is not only about themselves!  We don't need the ethics commission!  They will be  needing us very soon and we won't be there to support them!
