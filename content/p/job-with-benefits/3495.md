 So you're not elitist, but "renters" and "apartment dwellers" only shop at Walmart?  And won't shop downtown?  Not everyone who lives in this town can afford some of the pricier shops downtown, and some prefer better produce than what is offered at the one market. Your true colors are showing.  For shame.
