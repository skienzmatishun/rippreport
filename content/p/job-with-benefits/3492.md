 It probably was, but the Kant administration hid the facts beneath the flowers. I never knew until Kant was voted out.    Mayor Wilson has worked hard to dig up the dead and release the stench.  If we don't stop it now, it will be too late for our kids and our City.  I know that life looks ugly now, but if we can rid ourselves of the politicians that created this horror (which we are beginning to do), we can save our environment and Fairhope.  To whom is that a bad solution?  
As far as elitism, who are you kidding?  No one in Fairhope is trying to be 'elite'. We are simply trying to maintain a city center where it matters that everyone contributes to that city center.
