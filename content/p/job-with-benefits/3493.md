 Georgia, if you have faith in this mayor to lead us out of this mess then you are going to highly disappointed. The mayor has done some good, but real questions about her ethics that is the most concerning. If she is a leader, transactional or transformational, she simply does not know how to use her skill at the appropriate time. Again, you came here for a reason, implying that you had a high favor of this city. What bothers many of us when you post, you post as if you have deep roots here in Fairhope. You are the type to move here and then tell us how bad things are, and then you want to change us. Isn't growth a problem? Did you add to this growth? You moved here to enjoy what has been built over the past 25 years...so, no Georgia you want to be some elitist.
