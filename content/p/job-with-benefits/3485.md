 I don't know who is worse in the Jobs with benefit ring....Jack Burrell or Florida Rep. Frederica S. Wilson who is has always as she deserves more than others and she also has one of the highest unemployment districts in Florida pushing over 17%. When blaming Trump for the deaths of the recent US solders in Niger. She wants her benefits while forgetting that Obama sent them there in the first place.  She, like Jack does not give respect to anybody and disrespects most!!!
