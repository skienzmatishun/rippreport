 Why is it when a board, judge or commission rules against the moving party then those that have filed the complaint infer that everyone is a crook. I am glad the commission ruled in favor of Hixs and Burrell if they were to have been found guilty then think about the stain on this city. It appears most on this blog want this city to fail, for the city council to be shed in a bad light only hurts this city. Everyone wants the new mayor to succeed, everyone should also want to see the council to succeed. We have elections, and after the election, we need to move on.
