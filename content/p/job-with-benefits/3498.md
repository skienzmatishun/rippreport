 I have to agree with Bay Gazer. Walmart has fresher produce and much more affordable prices AND way cleaner floors than Greers does. Why would I want to shop in filth and pay higher prices for less quality. I also truly try my best to buy locally but if you shop downtown you pay ridiculous prices and even when you spend thousands of dollars at a local Fairhope shop and you ask one time "how about a small discount on an Item" they look at you like you are F big crazy. Walmart is great and is open 24hrs. At least the Fairhope merchants could have more locals save money days!!!
