 So, the people of Fairhope have to decide.
The council has to go. Sorry. Why? The land deal. The insurance.
They opposed going to districts.
Why? Remember that fiasco?  I don't trust these guys.
They seem self-serving to me. 2.7 million for rec land only
to rent to a farmer pal? Man we can't afford that kind of
corruption in Fairhope. If we allow this we will be up a creek
without a paddle before we know it. I hear of some good men
and women running for council. I am holding my breath under
water in hopes that it happens.
