Sorry for the delay of Freaky Friday - technical difficulties.

## A Southern Town That’s Been Holding On to Its Charm, for More Than a Century

### A Southern Town That’s Been Holding On to Its Charm, for More Than a Century

Fairhope, in Alabama, thrives as a place for artists, intellectuals and people of outsize character.

Fairhope just got a gold star and it deserves it. This article and the movie being shot, The Friend, at the same time, will produce a tremendous amount of National exposure for Fairhope. The cat is out of the bag, expect more tourists and newcomers to Baldwin County. It is to late to bitch about the growth and traffic and schools. It is time to act.

The County Commission and the 14 municipalities of Baldwin County need to get on the same page about Sewers, Zoning, Traffic and Schools, ASAP.

One issue that stands out in Fairhope, is education. The class size is swelling, teachers are working as fund raisers, “FOR SCHOOL SUPPLIES”, and portables are a necessity. Over 5000 students in five Fairhope Schools, and that figure is growing every month.

The Fairhope City Council has the responsibility of deciding if Fairhope is going to support schools through a TAX or use the Equitable School Funding Plan, proposed by the Mayor.

The Council has the ability to vote immediately for the desired funds, 1.88 million. It is their decision and that decision should be made after the community has the ability to weigh in.

## PEDALING FORWARD

### PEDALING FORWARD

Fairhope City Council has been pedaling backwards their whole term. They now have a chance to pedal forward, putting Fairhope on the map, when it comes to the city supporting education.

This funding issue is very important and would make a significant difference in all five schools. Principals, teachers, parents and constituents should demand the council holds at least two public forums for public participation, before any decision is made.

What will the council do? Pay attention people, election time is coming up, WATCH the council.

Will the Council live up to the accolades of the Times article? Or will CATALYST raise it’s ugly head?
