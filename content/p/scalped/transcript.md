# Transcript

Chaka launches his first stream on Kik and Rumble, starting with zero followers and feeling awkward, before shifting to a defiant tone. He moves from YouTube due to censorship, prioritizing open panels and live chat. He streams a police video titled *Women's Attitude Leads to Felony Charges*, warning it’s intense and may stop if off-putting. He highlights Rumble and Kick’s advantages: uncensored live music and movie streams, real-time chat pop-ups, and day-one monetization via ads, subs, and superchats—unavailable on YouTube. Despite low visibility, he streams via OBS from YouTube, directing viewers to Rumble with a pinned link. He confirms a glitch where his dad’s stream briefly stopped on Kick, but affirms live interaction is possible. A key limitation: Rumble chat fails to sync with StreamYard, only working directly in Kick. He shares a live music show with Casey Day and Luigi, restreaming Electra’s set. The stream features Magtail (Danish pale ale), a comedy sketch with androgynous costumes, and Prince in a Zorro-style outfit. He corrects a misstatement: Mickey Free is not a girl, and the stream lacks beat drops. A viewer misreads a two-triangle watermark as a symbol of "trial trafficking of little boys," prompting Chaka to stop engaging. He jokes about being the "manager" of a fictional group, admitting his brain is "farting" and he’s making things up. He shares a personal update: four kids—daughter in Navy, 21-year-old who proposed, 18-year-old wrestler now in MMA, and 13-year-old genius. His son made his first MMA debut in California, dominating a Brazilian jiu-jitsu specialist, with Chaka screaming in excitement, calling it a "hell of a jet." He recalls a moment of euphoria during a knockout, feeling like "the king in the world," and confirms he’s been knocked out himself. A tech glitch: Rumble won’t let him pin links, only allowing clickable ones. Prince’s stream has nine viewers, one possibly his ex, and new user Annie Marie joins. Chaka shares a humorous anecdote about his brother grinding mud on suede couches, prompting a family memory of plastic covers to protect furniture. He details his animation setup: 13th-gen i9, 32GB RAM, RTX 4050, and a 32GB RTX 2060 (used efficiently). He purchased the rig through Chaka via a low-interest, rent-to-own plan with credit approval for lower scores. He streams via Streamyard, using two monitors—32” and 27”—for multitasking. He notes Far Cry 5 and Unreal Engine run smoothly, with 64GB RAM ideal for animation. His son uses a curved 4K screen, enhancing 3D immersion and character modeling. Chaka credits a parking lot drawing habit at 17 as his entry into animation, leading to work at Pixar and Disney. He earned a $53,000 bonus at Masters Inc for character design, and a $3,400 pension from Pixar after 10 years at Disney (worked on *Beauty and the Beast*, *Astro Boy*). He reflects on Pixar’s hand-crafted, AI-free process: 250+ hours per hair for Sully, with fur tests failing until realistic behavior was achieved. He shares a keto diet, eating keto cheesecake, and notes a 215-to-350-lb weight gain from cheesecake. He promotes Helium Network (HNT), $1.14B cap, $12.89M 24h volume, and XRP, which he invests in heavily. He warns against buying on green, stresses holding through volatility, and shares a $100-to-$1,000 PEPE crypto win, later selling. He warns against exchange risk (e.g., FTX), urging personal wallet use and seed phrase tattooing. He recommends a $500/month iHub mining lease (3c/month cost), silent and unobtrusive. He warns of a global internet outage: within minutes, devices buffer, crash; by 24–48 hours, mass panic, riots, and potential societal collapse. He shares a personal moment: sitting in prison, drinking bourbon, reflecting on loneliness and past trauma. He recalls a powerful, spontaneous Jelly Roll concert in Vegas, which moved him deeply. He reflects on a past poker stream with 80 players, using crypto for entry and payouts. He plans a new tournament with real money and donations, verifying players via DMs and direct text. He praises Neil’s integrity, calling him a "standup dude," and confirms a Sunday/Monday stream with funds ready by 14th–15th. He admits poker feels like a chore, preferring panel chats with 10–40 consistent viewers. A copyright strike occurs during a *Journey* playback, causing regional blackouts and record label charges. After editing out infringing content, the flag is removed. He ends with a heartfelt moment: a song request for “Hard Spot” by Brandon Lake, sung by his son, ending with repeated “Hallelujah.” He shares a regret: jerking off with cheap shampoo, admitting it was inappropriate. He jokes about being a “loud bogan,” admits memory lapses, and vows to become smarter. He shares a raw moment with B Mike Anxiety, describing himself as “defective,” emotionally drained, and abandoned. He reflects on men’s silence, blaming fathers for passing on emotional suppression, and vows men must confront vulnerability. He ends with a defiant, heartfelt plea: “I’m still a baby,” “I ain’t no killer baby,” and “I’m not a man—I’m a man who shows up.”
