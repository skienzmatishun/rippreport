This week we are joined by two guests.  Richard Cox is running for Baldwin County Commission District 1.  The other is Whitney Scapecchi (@wyopp) of Southern Freedom Press to tell us about the Faux Pas by Rep Donna Givens once again reminding us that this "Catalyst Cabal" is nothing fictitious. Be sure to read the Ripp Report regarding this matter as well "Summerdale Sunshine".  Qualifying is over and the dirty politics we have all come to expect and enjoy like no where else on earth has begun.  The Faux Pas subject matter political event went off in Summerdale without anything eventful happening expect that Huey Mack was the only person on the microphone except the band. The legislatives session is in week 3 and Brandon Moseley and the Alabama Gazette have us covered with the goings on in Montgomery.
