 The current Council needs to go - they have wrought enough damage onto Fairhope - through their back door deals and selling their souls for profit so that Truland can do whatever it wants to do in our town and pollute the bay with overrunning sewers.
Fairhope is worse off because of them.  Even the last council who pushed through the Corte-Catalyst apartments were not as bad because this council upheld the damage that the previous council did.
