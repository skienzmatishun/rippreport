 Well Anonymous. How old are you?  You don’t have to be under 18 or 16 to think that only Jack Burrell is the only one that can be deposed. Because anyone in that room when Jackass went off can be Deposed as a witness to what happened. Under 18 or even 16 might post on this site and It’s a darn shame that they have to read all this stuff about the idiots on the Council and worse than that. They are smart enough to watch the videos posted of the Council meetings. If they agree with how things are. They too will end up thugs and will not respect men or women. Probably get their asses kicked a few times.
