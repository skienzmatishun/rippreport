 Jack4Fairhope, just because someone goes to church doesn’t mean they are Christians.  They could also be hypocrites 
Do you really think that just because someone goes to church that  they are Christian?   Of better yet do you think we buy this “I go to church so I am good crap?”
If you think we buy this crap then you are stuck in the 1960’s.
As for us if I need to talk to God I don’t need to go into a church and no religion has a monopoly on God despite what you think and what the crooked council members would want others to think
Geez, You are stupid in this king we are that stupid
