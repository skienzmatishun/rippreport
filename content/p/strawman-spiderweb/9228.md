 Jack4Fairhope is definitely a prime example of exactly what a hypocrite is. Say what you want to stupid? It’s amazing that you too are the problem and will never be the solution. Go tell Burrell he made a big mistake not opening Quail Creek back open sooner and blaming the Mayor while we told you week after week Burrell had the power and should have. We know what you are Jack4Fairhope. Childish people who get on their knees for Burrell. That’s all you’ll ever be!
