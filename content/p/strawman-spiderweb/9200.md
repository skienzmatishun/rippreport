 It is unfortunate the Mobile Register did not pick up on this story.  I guess the story takes too much time and brain energy and the Mobile Register does not have any “journalists” who can follow such an intense trail.   Ms. Bass must be complimented on her research
Also the Lagniappe has proven to be one ace of a paper.   It is free yet it’s coverage is most impressive.
When I am in Walmart I walk by the stand where the Mobile Register is on display.   I pick it up, see what articles are in it, shake my head in disgust at the puff pieces that are being masqueraded as “news,” and put it down.   That paper has become a joke
But I stay amazed at how a little paper such as the Lagniappe can pull in so much data and connect so many dots.
