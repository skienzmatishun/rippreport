 Once again, The Lagniappe, which was supposed to be a mere entertainment publication covering bands that were playing at local bars, is having to saddle the burden of covering the real news of the area because the of the sorry state of the Mobile Register. 
The Mobile Register has been reduced to being a shill for Shoe Station and has degenerated into an irrelevant coupon publication.
If it were not for the Lagniappe and local blogs like Ripp, one would think by just reading the local "newspaper" is that the only thing happening in Mobile/Baldwin is that shoes sell for 40% off.
