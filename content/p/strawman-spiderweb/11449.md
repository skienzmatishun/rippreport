 I'll approve this one.  I watched about half of it.  If you want to tell private companies who are breaking no laws what they can and cannot do, you need to make the Internet into a public utility.  You can't have it both ways.

I don't think videos like this serve much of a purpose here. Democrat or Republican. I don't have time to watch a bunch of videos and in the past, people have proven they are not mature enough for automatic approval.
