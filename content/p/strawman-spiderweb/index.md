Many people watched the bully council in their last meeting where Councilman Boone flipped out at the end of the meeting. What many people did not know was why? Watch the video again and you will see that when I mention the “Strawman” series in Lagniappe, Boone realized that I had read some of the latest information submitted to the Alabama Judiciary related to the case.

Many people watched the bully council in their last meeting where Councilman Boone flipped out at the end of the meeting.

What many people did not know was why? Watch the video again and you will see that when I mention the “Strawman” series in Lagniappe, Boone realized that I had read some of the latest information submitted to the Alabama Judiciary related to the case.

{{< socialpreview url="https://www.lagniappemobile.com/news/straw-man-lawsuit-reveals-complex-baldwin-business-partnerships/article_c12ba342-d0ee-53bf-9d15-6a24c5c18c4e.html" >}}

Boone panicked and did not know what I may say next.

He realized that the subject had switched from McSharry to “Strawman” and he starts yelling to adjourn the meeting.

It will take a little reading but the “Strawman” case demonstrates the depth of corruption and the spider graph links the players.

Some of the links are on a Lagniappe Paywall

You will see how a conspiracy works, how attorneys and judges disregarded any conflict of interest that they may have for favors from a few.

The latest article outlines a new lawsuit filed by a Baldwin County Property Association, Daphne’s Bellaton.

{{< socialpreview url="https://www.lagniappemobile.com/news/burke-delaney-implicated-in-new-civil-lawsuit/article_8078d5b1-2ebe-547e-b26d-02679e3a828e.html" >}}

> “The complaint alleges the defendants, named and unnamed,”form an integral part of of an intricate web of multiple concentric layers of companies that are intermingled around and intended, among other things, to conceal the interrelationships among and between, and to insulate from liability, the defendants, DeLaney and Burke as the principal actors who have ultimately owned, controlled, managed or directed the operations and financial transactions of these defendants and non- defendants.”

Now look at the spider graph and you will see how all these people in one lawsuit are connected to the Judge. Look close and you will see Mr. Boone, aka LLC Boone, linked to Scott Boone his son and Catalyst front man, are connected to Tucker Dorsey, The Strawman, John Avant and the Judge.

Boone has already been linked to LLC’s that show a conflict of interest, yet he voted as a councilman to assist the developers and John Avant, behind his constituents back.

The CATALYST council turned a blind eye to Boone’s conflicts of interests and now we see his connections to the “Strawmam” case.

Boone has lied to his constituents from the day he was elected, his loyalties lie with CATALYST.

Now let’s jump back to “Strawman” and the updated information submitted to the Alabama Judicial Inquiry Commission. Perhaps the best narrators of the deal and the years of litigation since, is Phillip Bass’ wife, Nell “Boots” Bass, and their daughter, Karen Bass.

Outright corruption involving lawyers, judges, County commissioner developers and third rate con men. Do you see the District Attorney or Sheriff doing anything ? Hell no these people are their friends.

This is exactly how CATALYST works.

My compliments to “boots” Bass and her daughter Karen Bass for outstanding research, and spider graph, good luck with your complaint against Judge Norton who has many questions to answer.

The Ripp Report will follow this story along with Lagniappe.

Baldwin County needs more people with guts to stand up and expose CATALYST and the blatant corruption within our Judicial system.
