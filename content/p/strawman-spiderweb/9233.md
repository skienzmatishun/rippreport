 Susie, you are right except that Lagniappe is
What we have in a newspaper
The Mobile Cash Register is just a medium for coupons and Gulf Coast Newspapers is just a puffy publication for local ads.  If you read Courier then you have read the Bulletin and the Onlooker
If there is any other source of local news please tell me because there is no other place where I can get local news other than through Ripp
Heck I even held my nose when Chuckie was writing his blog even though I knew it was the Catalyst blog
Right now if anyone ever told me or she is a journalist Working for The Mobile cash Register or Gulf Coast Snooze would laugh in their face because it does not exist
