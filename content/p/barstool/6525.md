 The fact that the sitting the City Council President 
1. Threatened to close down a private business purely out of a drunk tantrum 
2. Used City funds to fight a lawsuit instead of just letting a person say his piece at an open council meeting and then brags about how the city insurance company had to pay a settlement 

Is not only sad, but digusting . The councilman is a leader of this community and should act like it. He should reimburse the city coffers instead of robbing them.
