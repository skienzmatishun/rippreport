 The great land grab of 2020...thousands of unsuspecting midwesterners lending siege to the vulture developers...and CATALYST...which is nothing but a flimsy front for the good ole boys that have run BC into the ground in terms of infrastructure...the roads, sewerage and schools and impact fees necessary to maintain are not going to happen...BC is a ticking time bomb...increased commute times...increased school enrollment...increased crime...

all for greed.

Goodbye Fairhope...
