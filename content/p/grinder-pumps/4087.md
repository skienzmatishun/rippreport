 If Kant and his council pumped untreated human waste into Mobile Bay for years...
If Kant and his council minions allowed third rate developers use substandard/unhealthy grinder pumps inside the city limits...
Then Kant was absolutely engaging in illegal activities like bribes and kickbacks. He was, after all, rigging the elections with his father in law. (Rippster exposed this. It is how Karin won).
Fairhope has serious infrastructure problems but also a council bent on fueling building sprees for their developer friends and biz partners. Slippery slope for sure. Folks in Fairhope better wake up and get rid of the corrupt council and the corrupt single tax colony leadership. There has to be some better quality people in Fairhope. This is a serious call for leadership.
