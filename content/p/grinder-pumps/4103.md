 I can see that none of the Bible thumpers disagree with having no integrity. It’s a shame to watch these people act the way they do in front of God himself. I truly hope that they do not think they are fooling us. Especially God. Raise your bibles Tucker Dorsey, Jack Burrell and Trip Pittman. It’s become a joke amongst the true Christians in all of Baldwin County. Trip, you get laughed at in Montgomery at every turn. God will forgive you if you ask him to. But first you have to truly show him that you believe in him and not stomp on the words of the Bible each and everyday. Jack, your history and Tucker Dorsey, your flock are all now made up of terrible People that you have taught that you do not have to be a good Christian anymore. Just pretend you are and you will be awarded. Your award will be you leaving office this time. Biggest compliment that I can give you is that you haven’t been caught down at the Gullly yet?
