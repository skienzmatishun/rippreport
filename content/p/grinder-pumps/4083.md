 It is about time somebody wrote about grinder pumps.  Whenever you are looking at a house to buy and see a green box on the side of the house and it has a red light on top of it, WALK AWAY from it.  That is a grinder pump and you are looking at a $3,000 expense in less than five years.  Do NOT buy a house with a grinder pump.  That means the builder took a shortcut in building the neighborhood and passed the expense off to the buyers.  It also should make you wonder what other shortcuts the builder took when the House was built.
