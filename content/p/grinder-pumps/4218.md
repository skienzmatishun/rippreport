 Grinder pumps are required by the ICC Plumbing Code under specific situations. Top on the list is if the nearest street sewer inlet is higher than the sewer outlet of the building being served. This is because, as anyone should know, waste runs downhill. As part of the grinder pump system, back flow preventers or valves are installed to ensure that the waste does not run back toward the pump servicing the building. Force mains are sometimes used in lower lying areas to actually create pressure in the sewer system and force waste to city pump stations. There are subdivisions being built in lower lying areas, many of which are below existing city sewer main lines and city main sewer pumps, therefore, grinder pumps would be a necessity. Topographics and location of subject subdivisions are motivations for installation of grinder pumps. Who wants sewage in their houses?  From: retired Certified Plumbing Official.
