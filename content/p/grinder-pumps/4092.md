 On another subject after talking to a Montgomery politician today, I found out a few things. So called Criminal Trip Pittman is actually proposing a bill that will allow politicians and other crooks to actually have the right go to the Ethics Commissioners  (dishonest shit for brains) and obtain private “secret opinions” and these people who obtain these opinions from the Etihics Commission would then actually have the weight of immunity should it come up later in a court of law. This is a bill being presented by the worse F ING Politician (human trash) ever appointed to office or as ever held any office not just in Alabama but any other state that I know of. Thanks to Prick Luther he screwed all of us on the BP contract and stole almost a million dollars, but now he wants to have everyone ask behind close doors for a secre ethics opinion. Don’t forget about Big (what a waste) Luther Strange letting Trip Pittman off from being prosecuted for the BP scandal and many other terrible laws broken by Trip Pittman. You see how much it really helped ole Luther. What a joke. Pittman, do you time and get the hell out of dodge. We are tired of you (The Fox) being in charge of the Hen House. You along with Jack Burrell are two of the most worthless people on the face of this earth. Your Bible thumping ways are just laughable and this includes Tucker Dorsey times two.
