 Great question.  Can't wait to hear the reply.  Could we possibly get Fairhope's insurer to appear at the Council Meeting and discuss this?  This sounds dangerously close to fraud if the Council members encourage past employees to sue so that they can discredit the current Mayor. Actually, it is probably prison-time worthy!

 Additionally, I found it interesting that, when Mayor Wilson discussed having employees pay part of their exponentially rising health insurance costs (as every employer on the planet has done),  Burrell had a cow and insisted that this could not happen.  Is he so out of touch that he does not see that rising benefit costs are bankrupting cities nationwide?  Additionally, he was elected to represent the voters/aka taxpayers, but he has chosen to throw the taxpayers under the bus to secure support for his 'to-the-death' campaign against Mayor Wilson.   This is also something that should probably be brought to the attention of more voters.  Sad that so many people are so entrenched in the goober ways that they don't even see the rug pulled right out beneath them.
Something is truly twisted in Burrell's head.....but what a great idea to have our insurer's (Paid by our taxes) come to a meeting and discuss strategy!  Please ask people to show up for Monday's meetings!!!
