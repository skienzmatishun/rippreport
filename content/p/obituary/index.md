Frances (Fran) J. Neumann of Daphne, Alabama, passed away unexpectedly on Monday, June 28, 2021 from natural causes. She was ninety-three going on a hundred, her oft-expressed goal. [![](https://cdn.rippreport.com/eb5ab9e4-5555.jpg)](https://cdn.rippreport.com/eb5ab9e4-5555.jpg)

Fran was a prominent artist in Daphne whose work literally spanned the nation by virtue of her vast contributions to commercial advertising. She created the “Daphne” sculpture and fountain in front of Daphne City Hall, the Marietta Johnson sculpture in Utopia Park, Fairhope, and the Marie Howland sculpture now in Fairhope Library to mention a few of her public works of art.

 

She taught sculpture at the Eastern Shore Art Center in Fairhope up to her 90th birthday and continued with commissioned work in her home studio until her last day.

Fran designed her home in Daphne to facilitate her profession and surrounded herself with a variety of her own artwork creating a museum-like atmosphere. [![](https://cdn.rippreport.com/a7ee3710-3333.jpg)](https://cdn.rippreport.com/a7ee3710-3333.jpg) Portraits of famous musicians, literary figures and animals in watercolors, oil, pastels and charcoal adorned the walls.

Sculptures of all sized and media graced prominent locations in her home as well as unexpected spaces, revealing something surprising or whimsical in every nook and cranny.

 

She developed a talent in bookbinding, crafted miniature furniture for dioramas, and knitted miniature doll clothes. She loved classical music, built and played her harpsicord, and played the recorder in baroque ensembles. [![](https://cdn.rippreport.com/311249fa-6666.jpg)](https://cdn.rippreport.com/311249fa-6666.jpg)  Her work was her joy, and perfection was her nature. Fran lived a beautiful life that she fashioned for herself. She treasured her family and friends, and we hope she knew how much we all appreciated and loved her. Fran is survived by her sister Julia Miller, brother Jim Neumann, nieces Hollis Campbell and Wendy Miller and nephew Todd Miller.  [![](https://cdn.rippreport.com/935e7edd-2222.jpg)](https://cdn.rippreport.com/935e7edd-2222.jpg)
