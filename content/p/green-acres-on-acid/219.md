 The Alabama Ethics Commission is indeed a joke.  They wont go after anything that is difficult or anyone that is their buddy.  This is what corruption is.
Maybe I need to go to these prayer breakfasts and make buddies so I can become a goober.  Then I can get sweetheart deals and make lots of money at the expense of the taxpayers.  Isn't THEIR god good where they say "Bless us four and no more?"
