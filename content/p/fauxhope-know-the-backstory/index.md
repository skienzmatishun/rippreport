“The developer will do whatever the hell he wants, without any accountability”

THIS IS THE BACKSTORY TO GENERIC REPORTING:

The culvert issue was first addressed by the Ripp Report and lawsuits filed against the city over the Publix project on Parker Road. The culverts, sewer lines, wetlands issues, drainage, proximity to Fly Creek ,county right a ways, city easements, tree survey missing, were just a few issues---Fauxhope did nothing—then allowed the apartments-- same issues same no action—Now they are expanding building again behind apartments, the developer is given a green flag.

**TO REPLACE FAILED BOX CULVERTS**

>The city council voted to apply again for a $20 million federal ‘Better Utilizing Investments to Leverage Development’ (BUILD) grant to replace the failed Fly Creek box-culverts under US 98 with a bridge. Applications in 2024 and 2025 were not successful.”

The Culvert damage goes back to the Publix project and was brought to the city attention during the construction of Publix and during and after apartments construction.

Fairhope’s former Mayor Tim Kant and his former subordinates and entitled developer, Angelo Corte are to thank for a development no one wanted, except those who would profit. Catalyst supported the developer not the community. The City Council aided and abetted Mayor Kant and the developer while ignoring the overwhelming public outcry against the project.

Citizens made a horrible decision in the last election Mayor Wilson was addressing the issues that the current council has ignored. The corruption within the City government was curtailed and infrastructure issues addressed. Mayor Wilson obtained in excess of 10 million in infrastructure grants.

Mayor Sullivan and the current council will most likely NOT complete the grants afforded the city, before their term ends. Please pay attention and don’t vote for the same damn people again. Vote them OUT. Take a good look at the pictures taken today.

Currently they have clear cut even more property for multi- family. Single family housing.

HERE IS SOME MORE b.s

The Fairhope Marina is undergoing dredging to maintain the main Fly Creek boat channel, which is necessary every five years to ensure proper depth for boat clearance. The city has selected M & N of Alabama LLC to perform the dredging, with the city and Fairhope Yacht Club sharing costs for the main channel, while the city will cover the costs for the upper creek channel. Additionally, the marina has received a Clean and Resilient Marina status, reflecting its commitment to environmental practices and storm resilience.

Jack Burrell insists the mud is coming from the bay and going up the creek.

THE BACKSTORY HERE IS THAT THE DREDGING IS DUE TO DEVELOPMENT ON FLY CREEK—SUCH AS PUBLIX PROJECT AND APARTMENTS AND THE ONGOING EXPANSION ON THE SAME SITE. The FAUXHOPE CITY COUNCIL KNOWS THIS HOWEVER THE DEVELOPER IS THEIR BIGGEST SUPPORTER. THE MUD IN THE MARINA MATCHES THE DNA PROFILE OF THE PUBLIX CONSTRUCTION. THE CITY COUNCIL HAS TURNED A BLIND EYE TO THE ISSUE SINCE THE ORIGINAL CONSTRUCTION BEGAN.

MORE BACKSTORY:
THE SAME FLY CREEK HAS THE HIGHEST BACTERIA COUNT ON HWY 98 BY PUBLIX AND FLY CREEK AT SCENIC 98

ALL RED REPORTED BY BAYKEEPER

A red symbol indicates high bacteria levels > 104 MPN/100ml (> 235 MPN for Bohemian Park, Fly Creek at Highway 98, Fly Creek at Scenic 98).

BE SURE TO WEAR HIP BOOTS WHEN THE CITY COUNCIL IS IN SESSION.
