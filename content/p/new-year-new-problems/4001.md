 The entertainment vote was the first time I recall Boone and Burrell voting differently. There will be some kickback on this one as a number of restaurants have been stung at $1000/pop.
The partiers are going to be unhappy if the present law is enforced properly. Mr Ripp is correct; this whole thing is way overblown.  There are plenty of other things going down which need attention but this looks like a time eater. I do not drink and I have no problem with the partiers. You won't see them sh!!faced throwing up at the corner. Wait and see how much energy will be wasted playing around with this issue. I can tell you if I owned a restaurant and got stung for $1000 I would not be happy. That $ is going to Montgomery and it's just BS. That's all I can say.
