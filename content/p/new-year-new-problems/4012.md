 Time for Fairhope to look hard at itself. Introspectively. Crap in the bay. An obstructionist council. An unlevel soccer field for six million. A sewer plant needing a full overhaul after a full overhaul ($14 million). An airport sucking millions from taxpayers with nothing to show for it but two new vacay homes for J.B. Wake up Fairhope. Foley done passed us by.
