Last week, I knew that the Fairhope City Council was going to do what ever was necessary to stop the Oct. 2 2018 vote, to change the Government in Fairhope. The Council instructed the City Attorney, aka Council Attorney, to find any loophole he could to delay the election, he did as they instructed. The vote now will join the general election ballot, Nov. 6th 2018.

The Council has already started blaming the City Clerk and the Mayor. The Council however accepts, no blame, accountability, nor embarrassment. They are an at large Council and have deep roots within Catalyst. In the coming weeks you will come to understand that the Fairhope City Council represents the last vestiges of the King Kant Kingdom, aka Catalyst or quite simply The Good Ole Boys. On Nov. 6th Fairhope can decide to go backwards or forwards.

The below documents represent what The Ripp Report has been able to obtain so far.

Fairhope cut the head off the snake, now we need to get rid of the body.
