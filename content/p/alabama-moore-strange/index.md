Many thought that the Trump/Clinton campaign left little choice as two polarizing candidates split the political parties and beliefs. The Independents eroded the voting pool even further.

Well hold your nose, cover your eyes and close your mouth because Alabama Republicans have to make a decision as who to vote for in the Alabama’s Senate race. You want to know why Alabama is last in almost every category, except football and political corruption? It is our elected officials that WE elect. This election is going to impact the Republicans negatively in the mid-term 2018 elections.

BIG LUTHER STRANGE is going to Washington to clean up the swamp. He is the epitome of the swamp, exactly what you do not want to see in Washington. As Alabama Attorney General he did little other than let Sen. Trip Pittman off on BP fraud charges and then gave our Luv Gov a pass on all his lies and sordid affair. The Republicans in Alabama have been given their marching orders, and millions of dollars, from Washington, THE SWAMP, and Mitch McConnell.

MOORE STRANGE

Roy Moore has been thrown off the Alabama Supreme Court, TWICE. Mr. Moore would not have a chance in any other state in the U.S. with such an infamous claim. Many say how they respect his religious beliefs, while they ignore the rule of law and put religion, their religion, ahead of any oath of office or constitutional rights.

Big Luther is busy saying Trump as many times as possible while Moore try’s to say GOD, twice as much as Luther says Trump. The scary part of this equation is voter’s buy it.

That’s why Alabama is last! our elected officials.

We are first in political corruption and football.

Don’t forget: to forget to vote on Tuesday.
