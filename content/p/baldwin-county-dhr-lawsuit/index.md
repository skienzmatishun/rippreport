I have been blasting this message as a post and in comments all over Facebook, and will continue to do so.

A few people know my story and what was allowed to happen with my daughter. I have decided to go public with my experience with the corrupt Baldwin County "family" court, DHR and GAL systems.

They are wicked to the core and harm children.

But there is change in the midst and it's happening now!

There's a federal class action lawsuit forming against DHR with a law firm in Spanish Fort, see more here: {{< socialpreview url="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/16JtQE9UHt/" >}}

If you've been harmed by Baldwin County "family" court, DHR and GAL or mediation systems it is definitely time to raise your hand and be heard!

Please like the Page and join the Group. There's much more information within them:

Here's the brief story of what was allowed to happen with my then 13 year old daughter and an 11 year old boy while in the mother's custody and control.

Two minor children were left unprotected for over five months, despite clear signs of abuse, law enforcement involvement, and a court-appointed guardian!

See full story here:

This is a tragedy and reveals deep, systemic failures in Baldwin County’s court system, DHR, and law enforcement. 

As residents, we all have a right to ask:

Who is protecting our children when the very agencies designed to do so won’t?
