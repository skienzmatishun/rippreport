Two area’s lacking in leadership in Fairhope are the City Council and Planning and Zoning. The City Council President for the last 5 years has been Jack Burrell. All the previous councils rotated the position of City Council President every 6 months or after a short term in order to give other council members a chance of leadership. In fact, and it is a fact, this council has accomplished absolutely nothing, except to obstruct the Mayor at every opportunity. Mr. Burrell has not shown any leadership skills, he claimed that the council was the mediator for issues involving the city. The council has not mediated any issues with the Mayor and continues it’s game of obstruction at taxpayers expense.

Mr Burrell is responsible for the obstruction of the Mayor and he is responsible for the Airport debacle. He is responsible for leaking information that may assist disgruntled employees in their attempt to sue the city. His “leadership” has been to influence other council members to carry his water. Mr. Burrell has been involved in some of the worst decisions the city of Fairhope has made, triangle lawsuit, soccer fields, sewer plant, the gift of wetlands from Corte, and let’s not forget the Airport. Yet Mr. Burrell huffs and puffs and the council follows him down the rat hole. They sit in silence while he denies citizens the right to free speech or he publicly bullies the Mayor.

Mr. Burrell should be removed from the Fairhope Airport Authority and his position of President of the Council.

The other area lacking in leadership is the Planning and Zoning Board. Note I said leadership, because the new Planning and Zoning members, for the most part are all new, and a big improvement from the past.

Lee Turner is the head of Planning and Zoning and Single Tax. Mr Turner has held these positions for years, dismissing any concerns of any conflict of interest. It defies logic that these duel positions should be held by the same individual. Mr. Turner should relinquish one of the positions.

## Tatumville Gully

7\. Ordinance - An Ordinance to declare that certain real property (one acre of land subject to the approval of the Tatumville Project) of the City of Fairhope is not needed for public or municipal purposes in response to Fairhope Single Tax Corporation requesting the acre for the Tatumville Subdivision for retention pond.

This item appeared on the last council agenda, however was pulled in the work session without any explanation. This is the forth time this project has come before council or a work session. Mr Turner was the salesman for the project, the promoter for the development. He used his position and that of his good buddy Burrell to circumvent normal procedure, even jumping ahead of Planning and Zoning.

This is just like Fly Creek Apartments the developers come back again and again despite public concerns or regulations. The difference here is Mr Turner is front and center with his promotion and sneaky tricks to pass something no one is aware of.

It’s money, greed, and a select few, who we do not know yet, that are manipulating the system and Mr. Turner is their sales agent. He is head of Single Tax yet this project is the exact opposite of what Single Tax is about. He is head of Planning and Zoning and this project has not been approved. How many hats can he and Jack wear?

The citizens who live in this area and those in Magnolia Beach Condo’s had better be paying attention. This project will add 20 to 30% more water in the watershed that already has serious problems. Get ready Burrell and Turner are not done yet.
