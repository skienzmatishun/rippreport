 I agree.  It appears that most people in federal, state or local politics are increasingly 'feathering their own nests'.  We never actually see the payoffs that these people receive, but we all know that 'something really nice came their way' as a result of throwing their constituents beneath the bus.

  This was a great week in DC due to Tom Price ('Come Fly With Me, Junior'......he has to take a back seat to Burrell) was kicked to the curb by Trump and the American public who were so disgusted with this.  It may be a turning point in ethics and we in Alabama are in the spotlight now.  Stay on it and Burrell will end up flying with Price!
