 It appears to me that all of our politicians do not actually care anything about the well being of the citizens that they represent. It's become more and more apparent that the majority of the citizens have only had a handful of people each year to stand up for all the decent people and now we are also slowly fading away in numbers. This has allowed for terrible choices of candidates and even worse outcomes of elections. I'm not really sure what to do. I'm one of the ones who quit caring out loud. I'm not proud for doing that. I hope that we all take a minute to think about the way we are being treated by all the career politicians in office. Yes, even the ones who you think might to be "one of the good ones" they too are lying to our faces and playing politics with words instead of being honest and forthright. I'm pledging and hoping that all the good people who have given up like myself (it's a fact, just look at the percentages of voter turnouts) to get up and do something before we regret it even more. Let's make our community great again. But let's do it with decency and with democracy.  It is way past time!
