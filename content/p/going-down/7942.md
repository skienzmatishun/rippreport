 The Council’s deserves to burn in Hell.    They are. The spawn of Satan.  Boone, Burrell, Brown, the two other girlie men who lack a backbone are included
The crooked judge is a mockery who should have his robe ripped off.
It is a known fact that any appeal brought before the Circuit Court because of the City Joke of a Judge in Fairhope will be reversed
This is our City Court.  Enough appeals will throw the crooked judge out
Go speed in town, get convicted, and appeal to Bay Minette.   Watch your appeal be granted.  This is Fairhope’s kangaroo and cash register court
There is no faith in our city government
Foolhope
