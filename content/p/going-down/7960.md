 The sad thing is that those who live in Rock Creek never suspected that their dear Mayor Tim Kant and their City Council (headed by Jack Burrell) were going to trash their property values.  I used to attend Council meetings opposing the Fly Creek Apartments.  The venue was standing room only.  Mr. Corte stood back in the northeast corner every meeting making sure that 'his council' was voting correctly.  It appears that he still owns the Council but so much damage has been done already that this may not end well for anyone (other than those who have received 'something nice' in return for their votes.  Burrell and his Council buddies constantly tout 'land rights' about those selling their land, but they have denied land rights to everyone who already owns a home here.  Please vote Burrell out!  The other guys on the Council would probably 'man up' if they weren't scared of him.......does he have photos of them cheating on their wives or what?
