 The voters in Fairhope are so stoopid.   Yes I know it is spelled stupid.   But these voters are so stooooopid for voting in Catalyst.  I saw their Secretary of State expenditures report and saw how  they paid Scott Boone and Catalyst to get elected.    
You people in Fairhope are chumps 
I live in Perdido and I see how you are so taken by them.  Thank you for paying more taxes so my roads are paved    I am grateful to your Christian values
