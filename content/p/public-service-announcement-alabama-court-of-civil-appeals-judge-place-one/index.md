ALABAMA BEWARE OF THE CATALYST QUEEN

Alabama Beware, the absolute worst Family Court Judge in the state is Michelle Thomasson of Baldwin County. We the citizens of Baldwin County beg you to help us remove this judge from the bench. No words could express the amount of damage this so called judge has inflicted on hundreds of families and children.

More complaints have been filed against her than all the Judges in Baldwin County. If you care about families and children then do all of us a favor and help put the Judge on her broom. Michelle Thomasson is infamous, she has more baggage and skeleton’s in her closet than grains of sand in Orange Beach.

These are just a few of the articles about our Queen of the Court:
