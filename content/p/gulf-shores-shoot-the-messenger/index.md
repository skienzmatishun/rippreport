Gulf Shores Mayor and Council are acting the same way the previous Mayor of Fairhope, Tim Kant, acted involving the controversy of the Fairhope Fly Creek Apartments. The Mayor and his buddy developer ignored the sentiments of the community. It cost the Mayor his job as well as a few councilman. The collateral effect in Fairhope resulted in firings, retirements and resignations of over a dozen employees, who needed to go.

The controversy is not about apartments as much as it is about the location, location, location. “The development will increase the population of the City of Gulf Shores by almost 5 percent (based on 512 people or 2.5 residents per unit),” Sims’ remarks said. “The development will add 400 to 500 more cars on an already busy streets in the residential area, not to mention Gulf Shores proper which is almost in a state of gridlock now. If this development is approved, we feel it will not be long before the four-way stop signs in the "Small Town" section of Gulf Shores will be replaced by traffic signals. We were told by the Real Estate Company (Remax Paradise) that the developer planned to build townhomes. We were shocked to find out after the fact that a site plan had been approved by the city Planning Commission for a high-density, four-story apartment complex with absolutely no prior notice to citizens living in the neighborhood; as a result the residents were given no input.”

SAVE OUR NEIGHBORHOOD STOP REGENCY PLACE APARTMENTS, is the basis for a petition that more than 750 people supported.

The City of Gulf Shores current position is to ignore the complaints and threats of lawsuits by citizens. Gulf Shores Mayor and Planning insist all is in order and those complaining have no merit. Shoot the messenger or messengers. This was the mistake Fairhope’s Mayor and developer made.

If it were not for a few messengers, Mr Pete Sims being the most vocal, who have tried to alert the two complexes, The Enclave and Regency Club, of the long term negative effects the apartments, there would be no message, no information. Why are the boards not carrying the banner of protest? They should be the messengers, not the ones shooting the messengers.

Condo associations are notorious for lack of communication, residential geniuses, and boards that are more known for the confusion they cause than the solutions they solve.

Unfortunately The Enclave and The Regency Club are currently pointing fingers at each other, shooting the messenger and falling into an abyss of “NO ACTION”, which is exactly what Gulf Shores counted on .

Fairhope, just like Gulf Shores has Planning and Zoning regulations, and just like Fairhope, under Tim Kant, Gulf Shores violates it’s own regulations more often than anyone else.

 

WHAT IS THE SOLUTION:

Fairhope elected a new Mayor who concentrated on changing the membership of Planning and Zoning, with new appointments. The Mayor also updated Planning regulations and plans further changes as a result of public participation. The Mayor settled, all but one, of the pending lawsuits inherited from the last administration and a Planning Board who favored developers over the citizens.

Citizens of Gulf Shores need to understand that the problem is Planning and Zoning and it’s mindset. The Mayor makes those appointments. You have to change the Mayor to change Planning and Zoning. If you really want change then you also replace the council in the same election. It has taken 2 and half years in Fairhope with only one position left on P&Z, and he soon will be exiting the building.
