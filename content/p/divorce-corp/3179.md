 Rule incorrectly you mean. I know the lady who was pulled over and was drunk the first 2 times for sure. I would not argue the fact that she was caught a third time. The first time there should have been consequences. The second time she was caught there should have been jail time. Not for Buddy Brackin and his clan. The law only applies to those he wishes to apply them to and to those he should apply by law to.
