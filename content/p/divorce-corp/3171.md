 I have no idea what the previous comment was about; however, this latest item in GCNT is inflammatory.  When we have millions of gallons of sewage flowing directly into Fly Creek and Mobile Bay, I find it very intriguing that our City Council (primarily Burrell,Boone, Brown) are actively/wantonly trying to destroy our city/democracy/citizens by actively targeting Mayor Wilson for addressing the frauds of of our prior administrations.  As someone commented yesterday, there is a lot not like about Karin, but ask yourself who is looking out FOR Fairhope.  We know that Jack Burrell stands for $400,000/ year for the airport which does not even have a flight school........no flight school, no future revenue.
