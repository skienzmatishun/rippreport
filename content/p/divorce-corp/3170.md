 The wonderful Attorney "Buddy" Brackin - he was a founding Director of Vision Bank in Gulf Shores - he did things that was More than. "Conflict of Interest" for that Bank &amp; NOT LEGIT.   I have personal knowledge of several things he did &amp; should SUE the CRAP out of him &amp; Vision Bank which is now Centinnial Bank!!   I am checking on the Statue of Limitations.  Him &amp; Daniel "Danny" Sizemore did things that could put them both in Jail.   They both thought they were beyond the Law &amp; the Banking System!!
