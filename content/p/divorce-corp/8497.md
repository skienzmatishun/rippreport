 This Judge should be jailed himself. He has denied my husband Representation .he claims that my husband made too much money while he was the only one bringing in any income in our home of four two children we also rent where we live and we have all of our bills he did not take any of this in consideration as he denied my husband of legal representation .then jailed my husband for hey violation of public drunk for 180 days after his first initial send it was only 90 days how is this legal .
	now in the wake of the coronavirus orange beach arrested 80 kids On Friday night and had them all packed into the courtroom at orange beach after the CDC ordered no groups of 10 or more whatsoever but I guess they do what they want to when they want to in this court system here in orange beach AL
