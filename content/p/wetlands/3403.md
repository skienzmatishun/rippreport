 I can assure you that the Baykeepers will be left high and dry if they don't do a intense and great job regarding Fly Creek and it's problems. This will serve as a warning to all those who have anything to do with Baykeepers. This is your last chance to make things right. There will be new people taking over should this not get handled correctly. The funds will immediately stop even before people are replaced!
