 Oh yes Ripp!! There needs to be an internal audit by a firm not remotely from this area...concerning ALL that has happened here over the last 20 yrs. and then a forensic accounting finding of exactly WHERE all that money went, and to who. All of the LLCs these criminals have formed and dissolved over the years needs to be researched and deeply investigated. Maybe some of the scum involved will simply resign..they have to know the pressure is building to a boiling point, to get to the bottom of all of this criminal activity. We may not know, at this point exactly who did what, and what their payoff was/is...but if they now have enough fear over being found out..they may jump ship. The spineless ones. And if anyone thinks having a crooked city attorney is ok, and literally set for life..he has been at this crap for ever.. Off with their heads!
