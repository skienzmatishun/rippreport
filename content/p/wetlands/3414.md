 I thought it was interesting how Robert Brown was the only Council Member to postpone a vote to hire a consultant to recommend how much the City can collect for impact fees and then how the impact fees are spent.  Did anyone else notice that he didn't even get a second on his motion to delay until finally Burrell seconded for him.  Then I believe that Boone jumped in to vote against Conyers and Robinson.  Why does Brown not want anyone else to look at where the Council is spending the city's money?  Was this so that he and all of his developer buddies can pull as many permits as possible before we can collect fair impact fees?  
How sad that Brown has turned into the biggest disappointment on the Council....I guess he and his family will be moving after he helps to destroy Fairhope.
