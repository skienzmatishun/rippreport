 I think that Brown is becoming even more of an issue than Jack.  On Monday night, Brown was the one that refused to let the impact fee study move forward.  He, Boone &amp; Burrell clearly have an agreement to back one another up on any issue. Reminds me of junior high school girls blindly following along to be popular.
