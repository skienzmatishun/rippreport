 I spent a good amount of time researching just who is on the board of directors of Mobile Baykeepers, past and present. It appears flush with real estate people, construction companies, attorneys that protect them all and a few impotent folks that are appointed, that mean well, thrown in the mix. Just a FYI...worth looking into that as well. Unfortunately, it appears to possibly more of the same...the board stacked with folks that do not have the citizens interest at heart.
