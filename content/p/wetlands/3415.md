 Brown is a builder and he wants impact fees as low as they can be because the higher the fees the harder it is to afford to build. You did note that there is a cap on fees which means the more expensive houses pay a lower % impact fee. I was surprised Burrell voted that way. I realize many of the council votes are routine and uncontroversial but I find it amazing that Burrell and Boone have voted the same on every single issue. There has also not been a single issue where they voted on the losing side. Sometimes it's 3-2 or 4-1 but they have been in the majority every time. It's their way or the highway.
