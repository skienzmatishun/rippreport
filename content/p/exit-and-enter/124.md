 For all your continuous negative comments about how Fairhope has been run over the past decades, why are you still living here?  If Fairhope were so terribly mismanaged, why is the city the recipient of innumerable  rewards and accolades during this same period?  Why was Fairhope the subject of so many positive nationwide magazine articles touting its desirability?  Why are so many retirees relocating to our city?  Why do our city sponsored art venues draw attendees from all over the country?   I submit you are a malcontent who wouldn't even be happy in heaven.  You'd probably find something with which to criticize the Almighty!!
