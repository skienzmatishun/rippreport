The Ripp Report is a consumer, citizen, group. The intent of the Ripp Report is to inform the public of current political events as well as consumer complaints. The Ripp Report is a non profit and for the greater part, self funded, no-one owns us.

The Ripp Report came about because of the blatant corruption in Fairhope by the previous Mayor of Fairhope. Mayor Can’t was in office 16 years where he enjoyed a double paycheck, one as Mayor and one as utility director.

Between the years of 2012 and 2016, Mayor Can’t, Councilman Boone and Councilman Burrell used the utility fund, as a slush fund, to balance the general fund and pay for lawsuits. The result was Fairhope lost it’s best senior utility supervisor to Daphne and 3 million to attorneys. The threesome drained the utility fund and NO infrastructure work was done on the sewer infrastructure, while the electric dept was working on a shoe string.

Then the unexpected happened, a woman who ran for Mayor, exposed the problem and promised, prior to being elected, to immediately tackle the sewer and infrastructure problem in Fairhope that had been ignored for a decade. That was her election platform promise, she has keep that promise.

Mayor Wilson defeated the good ole party of Catalyst. The problem was that the Catalyst Council was elected and now had a Mayor who was a public servant and had no intentions of drinking the Catalyst cool-aid.

The written and documented proof of what I am saying is listed below. The Ripp Report could care less about your personal feelings about the Mayor but do not deny the truth. The current Catalyst Council has obstructed the Mayor and the city employees, from day one, with one goal in site, 2020. Catalyst plans to resurrect itself in 2020, under another name, but with the same dark soul of the good ole boys.

So if you are, finally, so pissed off about the sewer problem on the Eastern Shore, now you know what Mayor Wilson, not the council, HAS, been doing about these issues, FOR YEARS, since the day she was elected.

While the entire Mobile Bay has been degraded year after year by municipal spills and environmental damage, https://www.mobilebaykeeper.org/ has done nothing but fundraisers in Fairhope. https://www.mobilebaykeeper.org/ has had complaints about sewer spills in Fairhope and the enormous damage done to Fly Creek for over 10 years and NEVER did a damn thing.

The Executive Director, Casi Callaway told me years ago that Baykeepers could do little in Fairhope because their two biggest fundraisers were in Fairhope and Mayor Can’t would surely cancel them if Baykeepers did their job.

Mayor Wilson has done more in Fairhope than Casi has in the entire bay, don’t throw stones in a glass house Casi.

P.S. The Ripp Report heard Casi may run for Mayor of Mobile so look for more fundraisers soon.
