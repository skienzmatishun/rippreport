Make no mistake Orange Beach and Gulf Shores are committed to unbridled development. Chris Elliott and Tucker Dorsey,

Fully support maximum development without regards to infrastructure. They mask the “bridges” as infrastructure, when in fact it will only facilitate further congestion and more development. Mayor’s Craft and Kennon have the City Council’s in lockstep with their every decision and NO is a word not allowed when speaking of development.

The Mayor’s agree” there is no need for additional studies” because the Mayor’s have “ listened to the travelers and our residents who must navigate our congested roads”. They reinforce their decision by pointing out” it will create more and more revenue for the state of Alabama.” This will pave the way for Elliott to pass a 12% gas tax for the Mayor’s bridges.

Both Mayor’s just pulled off a major coup. They gave into their disdain for Chris Elliott and made a deal, with the devil.

All you Roy Moore fans take notice: DUI, Chris Elliott sucking up to Doug Jones, you know the Democrat. Elliott has sold his soul and is in panic mode, he will do anything to advance his personal and…

We will give you Jeff Boyd’s endorsement for your unconditional support for a bridge or two and what ever the hell else we want while you are in office, let’s hope that does not happen. Jeff Boyd proved he could not make a decision without the consent of the Mayor. He forgot about those who voted for him and against Elliott.

Orange Beach and Gulf Shores residents better wake up or you will not be able to launch a boat or go to the beach. Panama City Beach and Myrtle Beach should be a warning.

## ELLIOTT AND DORSEY ARE NOT THE ANSWER.

“People rub their eyes at the prospect of having $87 million on the table for one bridge and $60 million on the table for another, having $4 million on the table for a performing arts center and $4 million on the table for ball fields at the new school, so perhaps forming our own ethics commission is the least bad option for local oversight — restraining ourselves from an embarrassing scandal, protecting our officials from unwise inclinations, protecting another politician from legal jeopardy. “

Presently there is no oversight other than the Mayors and Council an ethics board would go a long way, except exclude the existing Alabama Ethics Commission from the equation. It needs to be a local ethics board and the responsibility of the citizens to hold elected officials accountable.

A new condo project is in the works for Orange Beach.

According to the Orange Beach Planning Commission, Brett Robinson Real Estate Development Co. is asking for the rezoning of 5.8 acres of property on Perdido Beach Boulevard to clear the way for a condominium development.

The project, which would be called Phoenix Gulf Towers, would include two 26-story buildings with 96 units each.

It would also include a seven-story parking garage.

The cost of the potential development was not disclosed.

A vote for Elliott or Dorsey guarantees that the fate of Gulf Shores and Orange Beach will be the same as Panama City Beach or Myrtle Beach. The more development the more the local residents get pushed out . The citizens of Baldwin County are going to “ create more and more revenue for the state of Alabama.” and have less access to the beaches and boat ramps. Traffic is already bad, however if the politicians are successful the Gulf will be inaccessible and:
