 Tripp, you clearly do not have a financial background! The lost opportunity cost would about a negative 2% due to the financial instruments that a county can invest in. If you received a 10% return over 5 years it would be 51 plus million. NOW, show me who has made a 10% return annually over the past 5 years - only those that purchased real estate in 2011 forward!
