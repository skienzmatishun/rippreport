 Actually, the reason the education system in Fairhope is poor is because there is limited retail to pay taxes to the city. When you have all the retail in Daphne and SF, and Daphne is looking at their own school system - Fairhope is not going to stop growth, the Fairhope mayor doesn't want retailers to come into Fairhope because if could affect her business.
We need to have retail off of 181 and 64, especially when they widen the road. If we can get some nice retail in here we can have better schools.
Also, if you look at Hoover, both of those school are in the top, Spain Park and Hoover. Because they have the retail and most live in communities that care not close to the retail.
