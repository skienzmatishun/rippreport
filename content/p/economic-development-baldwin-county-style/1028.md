 I'm for retail but you need to catch up on your facts. We could have also used the $300,000-$500,000 EACH YEAR that we have waisted on the Fairhope airport during the past several years that could have been going towards our schools.  Seems like you don't know much about what's going on. We don't have to compare ourselves to Hoover or anyone else for that matter. Do some more fact checking and then maybe you will understand a little more clearly. Sure it would be nice to have more retail. But why are we illegally spending over 20% of the Fairhope' city budget on a airport that is not even titled in the city's name and that 99% of us don't even use. We waist  soooo much money each every year on the Airport. The Fairhope Citizens are coming together on this. You'll see what we mean very soon.
