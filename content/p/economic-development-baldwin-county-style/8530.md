 Hey Anonymous, who says the overreaction to the coronavirus is stupid and going to the hospitals in this area has always been crappy. Stay you ass home when you get sick you pathetic bitch!!!  If you come to the hospital that I work at I will give you as good of care as I would anyone else but you are one pain in the ass that I hope I donâ€™t ever have to care for. Try working 20 hours a day with people who are sick and scared to death. If or when you get this virus!!! Say TFH!!! We all here at the hospitals that you think are crappy have plenty of decent people to take care of. Do us a favor, stay your ass at home!!!!
