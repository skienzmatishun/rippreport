 What is a masters prepared nurse?  Does anybody know? Does it have anything to do with a master of public administration in public economics, budgeting, and finance?  Or a bachelors in political science and speech?  Or urban studies?  If you were a "masters prepared nurse", is that important enough to mention somewhere in any public profile like Linkedin, Facebook, or anything?  Curious.  Chris Warner, do you know?
