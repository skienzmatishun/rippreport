 Such a scared little person like so many of you are. If you want to point out a fact, call someone a name or make a smart ass comment. Put you name down and quit hiding behind the "anonymous name"!  Be somebody instead of a coward like so many of you are. I'm proud to have left my name when posting a fact as I am very proud of the tremoundous increase like many of you that that have steered leaving your name and not hide anymore. You are heroes and the true owners of Fairhope. The true caring citizens of Fairhope are getting tired of hiding and they are showing it!!! If you have a suggestion like this comment. Leave anonymous!  Call someone a name or share a fact that you know to believe is true and don't want to be the coward you are. Leave your name!  Also the bless your heart person. We all know you only take up space and do nothing for our city, and you don't give a darn about the next generation. Move along! Bless your heart. Stick it your where the sun doesn't shine. Most of us know who you are anyway. So slither away and be done with you. These prayer breakfast are not fooling anyone either.
