 I see, so the mayor can just adjust her salary and all is good? Hum...so it was okay for her to fire someone that her friend could replace, all you have to do is reduce her salary and it all disappears like it never happened. This is how things work?

The mayor was not equipped to run the city, she does not have the skills needed and by the time she learns them she will have destroyed too many careers.

All politicians have good intentions, then, then they taste power and it is all over!

The mayor loves being the mayor, this more than anything she has ever done in her life, now that she is in power did you really think she was going to be different? 

She prides herself on being a politician now, not an independent bookstore owner, she's a politician and politicians are nothing more than politicians!
