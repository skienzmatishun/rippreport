 Does anyone have knowledge of the process of getting court documents that have been "sealed" opened back up for the public to see?  Once some of these are opened for all to see - those that believe there has been no corruption will see the opposite.  Yes the ones that are commenting on the corruption are Fairhope Natives - lived here  their whole life.  We are NOT newcomers - we KNOW what has gone on!
