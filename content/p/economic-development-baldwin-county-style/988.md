 Fairhope High School was NOT among the top 25 high schools recently named in Alabama. If Fairhope is the crown jewel of the county then what does it say about our educational system? Fairhope grew too fast. There has been no infrastructure improvement and no building program to meet the growth in enrollment created by the building spree. I don't know how we can catch up.  The cart is before the horse. Mayor Karin needs our support. Burrell and Boone and the builders are licking their chops.
