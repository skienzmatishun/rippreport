 Thanks for the information.  We have been wondering who was responsible for electing these corrupt people to the various offices.  Those of us that have lived here for ever know the corruption and recognize the good ole boy system.  So you think the Yankees are responsible for putting and keeping these people in office because that is what they are use to?  Well, that makes sense because we are certainly over run with Yankees down here.  Thank you for clearing that up!
