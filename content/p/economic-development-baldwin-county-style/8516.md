 This overreaction to corona is stupid.  Despite all the quarantines and locking up the economy, the count goes up
Most of the people who have it have the cold or are asymptomatic.   The normal seasonal flu kills more and yet we are overreacting
Going to the hospital around here has always been crappy because of the crowds.  Why would I even think of going to the ER just because  I have the sniffles?
I am wondering if the draconian measures may be worse than the pandemic itself
I think this is also a way to see how much control governments can impose on us 
Call me a wing nut but if this was the Black Plague I would think differently
Tell me where I am wrong. But don’t tell me about slowing the transmission or flattening the curve 
Tell me in two weeks the people are are still willing to be held prisoners in their own homes while the economy tanks.   Peoples’ jobs are disappearing because businesses have to close. 
Those people making the decisions are still getting their paychecks
