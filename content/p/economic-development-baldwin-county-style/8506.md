 I agree about the cookie cutter houses and that catalyst is a bad organization.  I don't know Cox or Corte.  I think you need to google what owned means.  I'm sure catalyst and the developers won't be a problem anymore in terms of over development with the economic crash.  Can anyone explain?  He posted this to give himself credibility for his constant commenting about the virus scam.  So, can anyone stick to the subject and inform me?  Maybe Jonathan Armstrong knows?  He seems like an expert the way he is talking.
