 Everyone knows that anything that is posted on facebook, or on the other site remains in digital form even if you delete them. There is facebook post that shows this, other folks were asking, and she was reminded of how warm it is down here. She was thinking about it!

Those pages have been screen saved and downloaded. The position was not even approved, had not been brought to the council yet, and there is post out there. Date stamped post!

SO, these documents have been preserved!
