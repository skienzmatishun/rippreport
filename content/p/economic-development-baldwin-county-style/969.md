 Everyone on this site is frequently alluding to ethics complaints and federal investigations; however, since nothing ever happens it is appears clear that no one has any interest in doing anything.  Again....we have the government that we deserve because we have not insisted upon their resignations.  Kant was clearly 'ethically challenged', Jack Burrell &amp; Kevin Boone have no scruples whatsoever, and now Karin Wilson has decided to feather her own nest through her Office.   It is heart breaking to see, because I think that Wilson had great intentions but she has been manipulated into destroying herself.  I hope that she can get it together, clean up her act, get rid of Botop (or at least adjust the salary accordingly so that Karin is no longer the 'court jester') and earn back the respect that she has flushed since her election.
She is on borrowed time (IMHO) but I voted for her, believe in her and wish her all the best in cleaning up the optics of her Administration.
