 Don't worry. You don't have to be new to Alabama or even have lived here for 40 years. Sometimes it takes more than just one election to get the job done. We still have all the leftover weed killer not used from the last election and will get it done. Sit back and relax and see the dreams come true. We just let a bunch of weeds get through the cracks during this last election. It's all under control. FAIRHOPE CITIZENS ARE NOT SCARED ANYMORE AND WE WANT OUR CITY BACK AND WILL GET IT BACK. KEEP IT UP FAIRHOPE CITIZENS. WE WILL PREVAIL. JUST KEEP COMING TO THE MEETINGS AND HOLDING YOUR GROUND AND MAKING THOSE NOTES. JUST LOOK HOW FAR WE HAVE COME. LOOK AT THE ATTENDANCE AND THE PROLE SPEAKING OUT. JACK BURREL SAYS IT IS A PRIVILEGE FOR US TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK AT OUR "OWN" CITY COUNCIL MEETINGS. ITS A PRIVILEGE THAT WE ALLOW HIM TO KEEP HIS JOB!!!!! There won't be another job for him here in Fairhope, come next election or maybe even before.
