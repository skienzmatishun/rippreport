 So let's see. Fairhope High School is not among the top 25 schools in the state. Imagine that! When you dump hundreds of new kids into a small high school it creates problems.  Unchecked growth folks. Our kids attend class in "cottages" a euphemism for trailer. Fairhope High School is a bunch of trailers.  Also, we dump raw sewage in the bay. Wonder why no one fishes or swims? Pollution. Human waste. Our sewerage infrastructure is aged and antiquated. One other little gem is that the lift stations across the city (fairhope has hills) have no working generators. If a hurricane hit this summer and fall the city could see human waste backing up into the roads and ditches. This is what Kant/Boone and Burrell did to fairhope. Wake up Fairhope. They stole your impact fee money and gave it to a bunch of friends...who kicked it back to  them.
