  Mr Ripp,  I always wait for your latest postings.  I am happy that you are encouraged.  You keep an eye on the city government in Fairhope and hold them accountable.  What do the folks have in our town to your north?  We here in Daphne have a "mayor" who micromanages ( Heck, even the Baldwin Insider rebuked him!), gives illegal permits to his buddies, and makes roads against the very ordinances he took an oath to uphold.  Then we have a council who, at the least, falls for his excuses, and at the most, is afraid of him.
