 At the beginning I was open to Robinson &amp; Conyers - no longer - they are into The 3 B's Burrell, Boone &amp;  Brown.   Sick of everyone of them - they All need to go - WHAT can we do to get rid of the entire Council??  We need to NOW get together &amp; dismiss all of them.  Everyone of them are SO FULL of THEMSELVES it is more than disgusting &amp; ridiculous!!!
