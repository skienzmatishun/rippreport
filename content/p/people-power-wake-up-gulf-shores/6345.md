 Alabama has the well deserved reputation of having the most corrupt government in the country, probably because of Baldwin County's criminal representatives.  I recently moved here and could not be more disgusted if they were beheading citizens in the streets; they are stealing everything that is not nailed down.  I don't know if the voters are stupid or apathetic or so old that they are easily misled (my first guess).
