 Catalyst is not so much as the "Montgomery Machine" as it is the "Baldwin County Machine.  If Elliott ever gets in then Catalyst will have spread to Montgomery.  Montgomery is NO match for Catalyst.  Presently, the Montgomery Machine is just a bunch of good ole boys from the interior of the rural state that band together to siphon off money form Hoover, Prattville, Madison, and Baldwin County which are suburbs of the established cities of Birmingham, Montgomery, Huntsville, and Mobile, respectively.  You see, the cities are too established to be taken too much advantage of, but the "rich" suburban places are full of young, na√Øve, and busy "professionals" that are too busy to get involved.  Therefore, these suburban areas are SOAKED.
Once Catalyst gets in Montgomery, there will a QUICK changeover in power structure and more severe than when the Republicans snatched the Legislature from the Democrats back in the early 2000's.  You will see more taxes, more laws and much more crony deals made but by different people.  The old power base will give way to the Catalysts.  Next stop, Washington.  Dorsey and Elliot already have already been planting seeds there, too.
