It is official our Biden syndrome Governor aka mee ma has successfully got our elected officials to Cut the Throats of Alabama Veterans.


{{< socialpreview url="https://www.lagniappemobile.com/news/ivey-backed-va-bill-passes-alabama-legislature/article_fce6d190-facd-11ef-a307-33a7aca215ec.html" >}}


“Lawmakers in the lower chamber did not debate the bill when it appeared for a vote of final passage Thursday afternoon. Rep. Ed Oliver, R-Dadeville, served as the Senate bill’s sponsor in the House.


The bill passed the House by a vote of 56 to 39. Mobile-area representatives Napoleon Bracy, Chip Brown, Adline Clarke, Barbara Drummond, Brett Easterbrook, Jennifer Fidler, Donna Givens, Frances Holk-Jones, Chris Pringle, Mark Shirey, Matt Simpson, Shane Stringer and Margie Wilcox voted against the bill.


“They cut our throats,” Riehm said. “We are already starting to raise money. We will not forget. We will actually work to overturn this. Whoever the next governor is, if they want veterans support, they are going to have to overturn this.”


Rep. Alan Baker, R-Brewton, was the only local member of the House who cast his vote in the bill’s favor. Remember the name along with traitors Greg Albritton and Andrew Jones of Centre who got the red lips award along with Rep. Ed Oliver.” Let’s hope there are some veterans that challenge them in the next election.

“The Biden Syndrome Ivey became unglued over the fact that Admiral Kent Davis filed and ethics complaint against the Department of Mental Health Director Kimberly Boswell who “colluded” with other state officials to divert 7 million dollars from the American Rescue Plan Act intended for the ADVA. Where the hell is the money? How did Boswell use the 7 million meant for veterans?”

“Legislation to “restructure” the State Board of Veterans Affairs passed the Alabama State Senate 21-9 earlier this month. Opponents say it is retaliation for an ethics complaint filed against Alabama Department of Mental Health Kimberly Boswell, a member of Ivey’s cabinet last year.

“Alabama is consistently ranked near the bottom for access to mental healthcare in the U.S., with Mental Health America ranking it as 50th out of 51 states.”

“Then ADVA Commissioner Kent Davis filed an ethics complaint at the direction of the State Board of Veterans Affairs claiming Boswell “colluded” with other state officials to prevent the ADVA from obtaining $7 million in American Rescue Plan Act funds.

To get what she wants, Ivey has called in a favor from State Sen. Andrew Jones, a second-term senator from Cherokee County. He should be targeted in the next election by a qualified veteran.

In the House, Tallapoosa County’s State Rep. Ed Oliver, the lower chamber’s Military and Veterans Affairs Committee chairman, has had a long-standing issue with the ADVA's management dating back to a 2020 showdown between him and Davis over COVID-era protocol at the Bill Nichols State Veterans Home in Alexander City.”

Ed Oliver, Red Lip Award winner, carried the water for Ivy and is also as vindictive. He should also be challenged in the next election, hopefully by a veteran.

Ask yourself where is the 7 million dollars that Mee Ma has ignored? Where is the ethics complaint? What about our Biden syndrome Governor? Our elected officials voted for their colleagues not their constituents. This is not the end of the story wait till our next election.

Jeff Poor said it best Kay Ivy is petty and vindictive.

Thank You Lagniappe and Baldwin County Legislative Delegation for backing the veterans, It will not be forgotten.
