We are talking super stupid, I mean extraordinary ignorance. But I get it, it is part of the moore factor, little m deliberate, the people that will believe fiction for truth.

Well Jack Burrell and Chuckee get the poop award .Chuckee and Jack are dragging the Courier , aka #me too, down the sewer. Their latest is a desperate attempt to smear the Mayor of Fairhope who had the audacity to screw up Burrell and Kant’s plan, by beating Kant. Nothing Chuckee has printed in 2017 about the Mayor of Fairhope, ever proved anything!

Jack Burrell and Sen Tripp Pittman are Bible buddies, I am not making this up.

Pittman served on the Alabama Ethics Commission. Jack and Pittman got a pass from the unethical commission. Go figure, Alabama Politics.

Pittman is by far the worst elected official that has ever held office in Baldwin County. His accomplishments could be written on the back of a stamp and still have room for the US Constitution.

His theft of 750,000 dollars from BP will be his legacy.

You get it ? Kant, Burrell and Pittman are all working with Chuckee. Fired employees and one current employee are also doing their best to undermine Fairhope politics. Now Chuckee cannot see far enough down the road to understand that light he sees is a train and it is headed for him.

Chuckee and Jack want us to believe poor Sen Pittman was not treated right and the Mayor was mean to him. That is the moore factor at work.

The Mayor put her statement out and I know it to be factually true. That means I have documents that support her response.

Kant is gone, not to return, Pittman is leaving, thank God, and Jack is now the number one worst elected official in Baldwin County. Chuckee is more than likely going to court and Jack is going to drive, their will be others in the car.

Sorry I could not deliver on the Christmas surprise before Christmas, but Wonderful Wednesday will be worth it.

MERRY CHRISTMAS
