 I was so happy to see Mayor Wilson defend herself, publicly, against Gulf Coast Media and their relentless pursuit of witch-huntery.  Cliff McCollum really needs to get a hobby.  He has entirely too much time on his hands.  He also needs to get another job because if he's supposed to be a "journalist" he needs a bit more training.  Another thing that's infuriating is how the followers of their FB page drool all over themselves whenever they publish a new EXPOSE, throwing out ridiculous untruths which GCM does NOTHING to correct. Case in point:  Mayor Wilson was NEVER involved in a "hit-and-run" accident in a company vehicle.  They know that and yet they don't even bother to correct the minions who perpetuate this crap.  I honestly don't know how that rag is still in business.
