 Don't forget about crony Tripp Pittman who should just move out of the state of Alabam. Had smelled bad every since he was appointed state senator. What a   F ing loser!!!!
Look at just the fact he stole about a $Million dollars that he should have had no control over during the BP Oil spill, gave the contract to himself, did a piss poor job and also polluted our bays by leaving all the anchors in the bay even after getting paid to remove them. Boom Boom Trip Pittman, a name we all wish we could forget. I wish he would run again for something. The worse has yet to be brought up. Hope my fellow equipment and tractor businesses are getting a fair shake now.
