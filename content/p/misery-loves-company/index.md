Daphne and Fairhope have a lot more in common than some think. One thing is that, if you allow the developers full rein, they will develop every square inch of land.

Fairhope has Fly Creek Apartments and Daphne has the Daphmont neighborhood at Johnson road and highway 98. The intersection has already been impacted by the recent construction of apartments.

A service station with 24 hour service and food facilities is now proposed next to the apartment site, further impacting the intersection and neighborhood. As usual, the residents living in the area were last to be notified. In less than 2 minutes you can reach 2 gas stations and at least 6 eating establishments, yet they want to put a service station on an already taxed intersection. In Fairhope, they put a gas station on a roundabout.

The apartment complex has caused a traffic jams each morning for residents and the school buses are overcrowded.

The residents of Daphmont have rallied into an organized group opposing the change of zoning. Daphne residents can expect meetings being canceled and rescheduled and their concerns will fall on deaf ears. They will hear about property rights without their property rights being mentioned. The owners and developers will present studies and data that supports the project and will promise road improvements, that will never come. The city will explain that the project was approved years ago and that there is nothing they can do.

To add insult to injury there is also conversation about Rock Creek wanting to tap into Dale Rd. that would take traffic to Johnson Rd. Rock Creek is experiencing heavy traffic congestion at the current Rock Creek entrance/exits on 98. Rock Creek has opposed connectivity through Parker Rd and Sandy Ford yet they want to connect to Johnson Rd through Daphmont neighborhood? Really! Daphmont is opposed to such connectivity as it obviously will cause yet further congestion in the neighborhood and the intersection at highway 98.

Daphmont neighborhood is being changed by non residents, their quality of life is being impacted, traffic has increased and property values will suffer, that is what your mayor, council and planning and zoning need to hear.
