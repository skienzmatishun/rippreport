Penny Sales Tax Debacle

David Peterson:

"I would like to clarify what transpired that led to the Penny Sales Tax being levied by the County Commission in January of 2017. When the BCBOE requested that the Alabama Legislature approve the extension or to make the Tax Permanent the Legislature declined to do so and wanted the Voters to make the decision. The Legislature did agree to extend the tax for 6 months, it was due to expire May 30, 2018, which would allow the BCBOE to not have a lapse in funding until they could get it on the November 2018 General Election Ballot. The BCBOE was not happy with the Legislature's decision so they approached the County Commission to see if they would levy the tax. A deal was then brokered with the Commission to exchange the percentages of the 1984 Penny Sales Tax if they would in return levy the tax. The County Commission opted to honor their request, this exchange cost the BCBOE around $4 million dollars a year in funding which now goes to the County Commission. I was in attendance at a town hall meeting in Robertsdale, sponsored by Senator Albrittion, when Mr. Tyler was ask why they agreed to the swap in funding. His reply was "Out of fear the Voters would not approve the extension or to make permanent the tax". With this being said it greatly concerns me that if elected Mr. Elliot will carry this mindset to Montgomery that the Voters are not capable of making the right decision at the polls, something to think very hard about folks!!!"

DID YOU TEACHERS KNOW THIS? CHRIS ELLIOTT AND EDDIE TYLER MADE A DEAL THAT WILL COST THE BCBOE OVER 40 MILLION DOLLARS EVERY 10 YEARS! WHY WOULD YOU VOTE FOR EITHER ONE? (The Ripp Report)
