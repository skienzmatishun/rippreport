Fairhope is being robbed of 20 million dollars and 106 acres of land. The bandits are The Weeks Bay Foundation and their collaborative partners the Fairhope City Council.

The director of Weeks Bay said they did not want to do anything against the wishes of the citizens of Fairhope. Sound familiar ! that is the same thing that was said about the Fly Creek Apartments. Monday night, Weeks Bay will make another attempt, with the help of the council, to gain control of Fairhope City Property for PERPETUITY, aka ETERNITY.

The Council has had no public participation on the Conservation Easement. This is a council known for doing nothing! So why is this such a rush? Who is the anonymous donor that is greasing the wheel of this robbery? Let me make this perfectly clear, Diana Brewer of Weeks Bay, no friend of Fairhope and Council President Burrell, the worst of the worst, are the driving forces. They are backed up by Fairhope City Attorney, Marcus McDowell, who should be removed as soon as possible.

I will make an open bet of a $1000.00 that this secret donor is in some way connected to Author Corte.

Three of the present Fairhope Council, Burrell, Brown and Boone have all used their office for personal gain while the other two buried their heads, closed their eyes and covered their ears. I know this is a strong allegation but do not expect any one of the three to discuss this in public. Facts back up the allegations.

This is it FAIRHOPE, You let this council ignore you and steal your land and do nothing, then expect them to come back to the trough.

## PLEASE SHARE THE PETITION, YOU DO NOT HAVE TO SHARE THIS POST. SHARE THE PETITION AND VOICE YOUR COMMENTS.

## CALL WEEKS BAY AND THE FAIRHOPE COUNCIL LET THEM KNOW YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH BEING ROBBED.
