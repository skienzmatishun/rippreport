Fairhope’s mayor extended an olive branch to the city council and they accepted it. The last city council meeting was civil, polite and cordial among council and mayor. They are going to have difficult times but as long as they put the city first then it will make solving issues easier.

Fairhope still has baggage from the last administration that will come up time to time and the council would be well served to remember that the past administration’s baggage is something the new council inherited from the previous council.

The issues that have come up since taking office should be as transparent as possible. The council should adopt a policy of conducting an internal review into subjects that are controversial and have generated citizen complaints. The results of the internal review would be made public. Leaving the public hanging for answers will only create more questions and distrust of our municipal government.

Cats and dawgs can get along. If they want to.
