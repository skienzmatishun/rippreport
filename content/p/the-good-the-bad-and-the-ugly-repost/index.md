## FAIRHOPE THE GOOD

Fairhope has come a long way in the last 2 and ½ years. Infrastructure, sewer problems and planning and zoning all have gotten the attention of the new administration. The employees, supervisors and city staff are the best qualified personal the city has ever employed. These accomplishments did not come easy and did not come with any assistance of the Catalyst Council, who has yet to accomplish anything significant. More and more of the citizens of Fairhope are beginning to understand that the council’s agenda has been obstruction and their goal is to overthrow the present government in 2020. Mayor Wilson and staff deserve to be commended on their accomplishments and their promise to put the city before politics.

Fairhope’s clock and an area around the clock will be saved, thanks to the developer and Mr Dean Mosher who requested the developer, Matt Bowers, to reconsider changes to his original plans. Let’s hope this works out. It is nice to see a developer who considered the community in his plans.

## FAIRHOPE THE BAD

The triangle lawsuit cost the city 11.25 million. It could have been settled for under 1 million. Mayor Can’t, the city council members Boone and Burrell, along with the 3 members that were voted out, refused to settle or even discuss settlement.

Recently the last of the bad lawsuits inherited from the last administration and the same two councilmen, appeared to be a mirror image of the bad management in the Triangle lawsuit. Fairhope prevailed recently in the latest, Breland, court preceding. This followed a unanimous decision by the Alabama Supreme Court that favored the developer, Buddy Breland. The lower court’s verdict is now being appealed back to the Supreme Court.

This is exactly how the Triangle case worked its way through court. The Catalyst Council refused to discuss settlement, choosing to spend ten’s of thousands in attorney fees and court costs.

If Mr Breland wins his lawsuit, and all his previous project permits expire, Fairhope could be looking at millions in damages. Fairhope again is held hostage by a council that is more intent on obstruction, and the wishes of Catalyst, than what is the best for the community.

## FAIRHOPE THE UGLY

{{< socialpreview url="https://rippreport.com/p/communication/" >}}

The charges against Ronan McSharry, McSharry Bar and Restaurant, were never heard on the scheduled date and the case has been delayed until March. This is the typical way many cases are handled, delay delay, appeal and then blame the victim or anyone else, other than the guilty party.

McSharry’s has been the watering hole for many Judges, Attorneys and Council Members. It is true many have abandoned the location due to the continuous bad behavior of Mr McSharry, who is a green card holder, not a citizen of the United States.

The City Attorney, Marcus McDowell, has done a poor job of protecting the community. He was satisfied to slap Mr. McSharry’s hand in the past offenses, which did nothing to discourage McSharry’ s drunken assaults and harassment of innocent citizens.

The City Attorney has done a good job protecting the council, especially Mr. Burrell, with our tax dollars. Don’t forget how the council and city attorney, when faced with a potential change of government, changed an establish voting date, at the last minute, and then topped it off by providing 1 voting booth per precinct, ensuring long waits to vote.

The Ripp Report will be paying attention to both the Breland case and what creative legal maneuvers the City Attorney comes up with, in the bar stool incident. Be prepared, Catalyst has a bid bag of dirty tricks and they protect their own.

Pay attention ladies, what if this happened to you?
