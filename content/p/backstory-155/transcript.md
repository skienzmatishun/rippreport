# Transcript

Attorney General Steve Marshall declares ESG poses a "clear and present danger" to Alabama consumers and key industries like steel, coal, and agriculture, accusing an unelected global cabal of orchestrating at least 10 alliances—such as Climate Action 100 and Net Zero Banking Alliance—to implement radical ESG policies without democratic oversight. These alliances, requiring private coordination to meet ESG standards, undermine fiduciary duties by prioritizing ideological agendas over profitability and erode investor trust, especially in retirement funds managed by BlackRock, Vanguard, and Merrill. Marshall sues the Department of Labor over proposed ESG 401(k) rules, citing threats to financial independence and energy security. ESG-driven investment restrictions block fossil fuel development, including offshore projects off Orange Beach, while favoring Chinese-made renewable components, increasing foreign dependency and strategic leverage. Critics allege anti-competitive collusion and constitutional breaches, with Republican AGs challenging ESG’s legitimacy. The Austrian economic perspective, emphasizing individual choice and methodological individualism, contrasts with centralized ESG models, though its influence wanes amid massive fund management. The Alabama Policy Institute launched 1819 News to counter ESG influence; Dr. Alan Mendenhall warns ESG enables state overreach and "tautism," eroding free markets. In response, the Alabama Senate funds Troy University’s Free Enterprise Scholars Program, promoting anti-ESG messaging. A day after Mendenhall’s speech, former President Trump appears in a CNN town hall, denying the 2020 election loss, blaming external forces, and claiming the Russia-Ukraine war could have been avoided with his 2020 victory. He asserts pro-life groups are poised for a "good, satisfactory deal." Trump defends his absence from a $5 million jury verdict case, claiming it caused the conviction. Media narratives diverge sharply—CNN criticizes the town hall, while Rumble presents a contrasting view. Ongoing overtime spending at the sheriff’s department exceeds $921,000 since 2018, with deputies earning up to $170,000, sparking taxpayer concern and calls for state takeover of Pritchard and water board reforms. Senator Figures calls Mobile a "failed state," citing water and sewer corruption, a multimillion-dollar mismanaged contract, and a failed grant application. The city votes 6-0 to allow a referendum on annexing West Mobile, risking land cession under false promises of infrastructure. Baldwin County sees rising development resistance, with three annexations—Baymanette, Spanish Fort, Magnolia Springs—bypassing voluntary agreements via legislative acts. Mobile allows large property owners to join via pre-annexation voting, with zoning approved for multi-family and business use. A Republican bill asserts parents’ constitutional right to raise children, facing backlash from Black Democrat Wanda Lynn Gavann. Another Republican-led bill seeks to block Chinese real estate purchases in Alabama, citing geopolitical fears, though criticized as reactionary and ineffective, especially as it bans Chinese investment while allowing Iranian or Russian entry. The speaker disputes claims of Chinese farmland ownership, noting Canadians hold most foreign timberland. Alabama aligns public works steel standards with federal law, mandating U.S.-sourced steel to avoid federal funding compliance issues. A 20-year trend of manufacturing decline is traced to Bill Clinton’s free trade agreement, which Ross Perot predicted would cause a "giant sucking sound." Amtrak’s New Orleans service remains unresolved, with the mobile stop undecided. Mike Dow’s maritime museum faces traffic issues due to train tracks forcing commuters to cross, risking two-hour delays. A nine-hundred-and-ten-bed jail expansion in Baymanette and a new justice center are under discussion, but with only seven new judges approved—short of the Chief Justice’s request of twenty-one—the system faces severe backlogs, with many convicted individuals already jailed and awaiting trial. Peru approves extradition of Jordan Vandersleuth, son of a former U.S. federal judge, for the disappearance of an 18-year-old American student; despite his prior conviction, Peru’s lenient sentencing raises concerns. The UAR-10 rifle, introduced in 2018, has become widespread in Ukraine, replacing older Soviet models. A lighthearted nod to FN’s legacy—via a Hawaiian shirt—contrasts with the seriousness of Ukraine’s shift to NATO-standard weapons. The hosts conclude with well-wishes and a reminder to send gifts to mothers.
