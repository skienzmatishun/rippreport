 Those who continue to focus on Pitman Brown remodeling the Art Center are missing the point.  Cliff Pitman is very respected and very in demand.  There would be no reason for his company to 'need' this contract,  and I can't imagine Pitman lowering himself to pay Burrell any bribes. He has been respected for decades....why would he trash his rep for a fool like Burrell?   Unless you have documents proving fraud and kickbacks,  please stop trying to stir this up. All it does is make Burrell stronger.
