 I don't believe that it should make any difference whether those 'at the table' are male or female if they are all honest and sane.  Clearly, that is not the case in Fairhope.  Why do Robinson and Conyers fear Burrell so much, and why don't any of them (hello, Robert Brown) ever challenge him when he is so clearly in the wrong 90% of the time?
