 As long as Catalyst rules then the majority of women in power will be owned by Catalyst and the puppet master real estate developers.  
See? Catalyst is an equal opportunity sell out for Baldwin County.  You can be a man or woman; you just need to tow the party line of fronting as a "Christian Conservative" and ready to drop a few hundred houses, or better yet, apartments, on a two lane road at a roundabout.
Don't worry about the schools, roads or crime, just build cheap houses and get mega bucks for them.
