 Congrats to Paul Ripp. He is the big winner in this round of elections. 
Catalyst won one of three elections.

Elliott the criminal is their only winner. The democrat Fisher looks like a real 
possibility for many because they will be voting for a democrat for governor over
Gay Ivy.

It appears the tide has turned with respect to catalyst. Elliott may be the last 
candidate they get elected. 

15 percent turnout?

Can you say "walking dead"? Ripp at some point you have to admit that you cannot
make chicken salad out of chicken sh*t.

Congrats to Christy Edwards and Billie Jo Underwood. 

Let's hope that B.C. wisens up and retires Chris Elliott. He is bad news for the county.
