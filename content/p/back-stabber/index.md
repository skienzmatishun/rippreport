As predicted Mr Jack Burrell plans to make decisions for the whole community without a single public hearing. This is the after hours e-mail, 5:05 pm on a Friday, before a three day vacation. This should prove to you how the entire council, led by Jack Burrell is about to pull off the most rotten trick on Fairhope citizens since the settlement of the triangle lawsuit, Jack was part of that as well.

From: Lisa A. Hanks, MMC Sent: Friday, August 31, 2018 5:05 PM To: Lisa A. Hanks, MMC <lisa.hanks@cofairhope.com> Subject: Special Called Council Meeting - September 4, 2018 at 4:00 p.m.

Attached is a public meeting notice for a Special–Called City Council meeting at 4:00 p.m. prior to the Work Session/Budget Meeting at 4:30 p.m. Have a great weekend and holiday (Labor Day).

If you have any questions please contact me.

Public Meeting Notice SPECIAL CITY COUNCIL MEETING Date & Time: Tuesday, September 4, 2018 at 4:00 p.m. Place: Council Chambers 161 North Section Street Subject: Resolution to Authorize the Council President to execute a Real Estate Purchase Agreement for properties owned by the Baldwin County Board of Education Notice must be stamped, dated and initialed before posted on bulletin board.

Please note it says for the “Council President to execute a Real Estate Purchase Agreement”. This is for the k-1 Center and the PLAN the Council, has decided they want without any public participation.

Mayor Karin Wilson of Fairhope, Alabama 2 hrs ·

Please share with your Fairhope friends. I have communicated with Council President Burrell about the K-1 Center property purchase and taking this opportunity to discuss all property owned by BCBE in our City (Nix Center land, K-1 “Fairhoper’s” Park and the Alternative School). I expressed to him the importance of transparency with all possibilities for the best use of the K-1 property and how its future use needs to be communicated with all stakeholders. There should also be a feasibility study done. These decisions have long lasting effects on our City and should not be rushed. We should not repeat past mistakes. This is why I was surprised to receive the notice at 5:05pm on Friday, before the long Labor Day weekend, when people were busy getting ready to spend time with their families and not concerned with City business, about a Special Called City Council meeting to approve a “Resolution to Authorize the Council President to execute a Real Estate Purchase Agreement for properties owned by the Baldwin County Board of Education” for Tuesday 4pm. Rushing the city into real estate deals without public participation and input by stakeholders is an inappropriate way to conduct business. Fairhope citizens are unaware of the developments concerning these properties and alternate opportunities. If the rest of Council truly wants to be transparent and make proper decisions, they will cancel this meeting and make certain all facts are presented in a public forum before we move forward on spending millions of tax dollars. In addition, due to expected weather associated with Tropical Storm Gordon, I will be canceling the specially called work session to discuss the budget at 4:30pm.

Wake up Fairhope this City Council is stabbing you in the back and Jack is holding the knife.
