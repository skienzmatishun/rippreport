Alabama is the most political corrupt state in the United States. Why? because it is so easy for lobbyist to buy the needed politicians to keep it corrupt.

Alabama is going to be the laughing stock of all the other states that have lotto’s. It is going to cost us billions, but what the hell Alabama is famous for turning down Billions.

You don't need a task force to tell which way the wind blows.

The media is so poor that very few people even know anything about the details of the Lotto, the latest political sell out. For 20 years Alabama has talked about an education lotto and now education is not even mentioned.

Alabama is going to give the lottery away to the highest bidder, the Poach Creek Indians. You sure cannot blame the Poach Creek Indians for understanding how to manipulate our good Republican…

Alabama’s answer to education is portables. Our prisons are so deplorable that we need to build more. Now, our sold out politicians have come up with a state lottery that pays off debt from the general fund as far back as 2013. Not one damn dime for education, only prisons and past debt.

### Opinion | Other states use lotteries to give kids a brighter future. Alabama wants to use lottery to build prisons

We have a vision problem in Alabama. We’ve always had a vision problem in this state. We are perpetually satisfied with how things are, with keeping things how they are, with resisting any change whatsoever. “Nah, we’re good,” should be our state motto. Even when making a change would benefit us, we resist. Even when \[…\]

The Indians have scalped Alabama politicians, they did not even need a knife, just money.

It takes in less than half than any other state and gives the state's largest campaign donor a machine gambling monopoly.

“PCI has pumped $4.5 million of campaign contributions into Alabama’s political bloodstream since 2013 (a virtual tie for the largest contributor with Business Council of Alabama’s Progress PAC).”

Alabama is run by the lobbyist and Business Council of Alabama. The politicians are giving away BILLIONS, but what the hell they got 4.5 million in campaign contributions.

The TAXMAN Senator Elliott got 27,000 from the Indians to get elected. This is the third time Elliott has gone against campaign promises and favored special interests. Elliott has betrayed the children of Baldwin County, time and time again, and ignored the promises he made to the rest of the citizens.

### PCI tribe admits state played into their hands, still calls Alabama ‘their deadliest enemies’

Former Poarch Creek Band of Indians’ attorney general in the fall of 2016 bragged to the magazine “Indian Gaming Lawyer” that the state of Alabama played into the tribe’s hands giving the Indians a de facto monopoly of gaming in the state. Last summer, PCI tribal chief Stephanie Bryan wrote the Bureau of Indian Affairs \[…\]

“Why senators like Marsh and Albritton continue to do PCI’s bidding even after they called the state their deadliest enemies is a mystery.”

The tribe admits the state was played, that they plan to expand their empire and will not pay taxes. It seems some have not only ignored Trump’s warning but the one that PCI has stated about itself.

Alabama is going to lose BILLIONS, with the political lottery, and at the same time will ensure Poarch Creek Indians a gaming monopoly.

## EDUCATION IS LAST AGAIN, THANK THE TAXMAN
