 Keep letting the subdivisions go in and crowd us out.   Then you better get use to trailer park schools, crowded roads, more crime, higher taxes, polluted bay, and a lower quality of life just so a few out of town developers can make a buck off of stealing our home town.
By the way, do you know how much one of those trainers rent for?   Just ask Williams Scotsman, the suppliers of those trailers.   I can tell you they rent for over $800.00 per month. 
This is just so D R Horton can make money
