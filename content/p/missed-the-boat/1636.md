 This is not reporting but slanderous! 

So how is Fairhope going to stop the growth in Daphne? What everyone needs to understand this area is growing so they need to embrace it, plan for it and work with developers! Fairhope is not going to stop it because Daphne and other municipalities want the tax dollars. Daphne has the big-box retailers and the tax base to possibly start a city school system. Because of this tax base, Daphne can do more with less population. However, with more retail comes more population, if they build it they will come! 

Fairhope will never be a Seaside, Seaside was built from the ground up, Fairhope has been here a while. Fairhope needs to take advantage of 181 being widened and plan for some retail out that way, Fairhope planning area is going to grow regardless of what others may want. It simply can not be stopped, property owners do have strong property rights in Alabama. Get over it!
