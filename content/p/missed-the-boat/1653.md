 The good ole boys have all been paid off for all the deals that were in the works when kant was defeated (rightly so). Fairhope is getting too big. It is already not the retirement destination it used to be. It's more like a place for young families that has gotten entirely way out of hand. When these young kids need a 8A high school in ten years everyone is going to see that the cart went way before the horse.  So if the sewers and roads aren't up to snuff then why are we even considering corte's apartments? What is the plan to grow the infrastructure and schools (new buildings are neeeded)? Come on goobers we cannot have it both ways! We need to slow the frick down and preserve what we have. Jack you and Kevin Boone better realize people know about you now. Please understand we want to save our city.
