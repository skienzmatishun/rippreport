 Nothing should be built until the roads are taken care of.  We do not have enough jobs in Daphne to handle all of the apartment complexes being built.  Commutes are way to long already.  We do not need anymore traffic than what we can handle.  It has gotten crazy around here.  Greed is a terrible thing.
