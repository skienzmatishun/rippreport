 I don't blame the bad weather on the council but the blame does fall on the past council for not ever fixing the infrastructure That cannot withstand this weather. People need to be held accountable!! On a night like this... Just go outside and you can smell the sewer at the bay, by fly creek, in the wetlands!! It's a travesty!!
