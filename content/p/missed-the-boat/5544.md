 Well this is just in.  The provisional ballots have been counted for circuit clerk and Jody Wise has more votes the the Catalyst candidate.  Another Catalyst bites the dust.   I count nine races that Catalyst has managed because I count Battle for governor was run by Catalyst down here. Battle lost.  
So the way I count it Catalyst is 3 for 10 without counting the run offs for state senator and county commission place 3.  We just need for Underwood and Northcutt to win these run offs to get future candidates to stop selling their souls to Stacey, Cox, Elliot, Pribble, Boone, and the rest of the Good Ole Boys.
