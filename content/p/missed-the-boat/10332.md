 Looks like Daphne is finally coming to its senses
Haygood says he did not run because God told him to do other things.
Bahahahahaha
Haygood didnâ€™t run because he pissed off his Catalyst handlers and wanted to micromanage the town which really means he wanted to control the developers.   When you are a Catalyst politician, Catalyst tells you what to do and not the other way around
Hey Haygood:   What does God tell you now?
