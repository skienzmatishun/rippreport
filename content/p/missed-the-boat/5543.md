 Yep she is trying to drain the swamp while being up to her waist in alligators.   She is one tough and determined person.   I admire her tenacity against the cowardly council.   Look, we know that meeting with Pettis was a staged event and she stood up to the crowd and the bullies on the council.   Most men would be in tears, but this woman showed she had more backbone than the rest of the council
See Karin?  We do have your back.  I was there at the council the other night watching you show what grits, guts and glory looks like and you made it look so darned good.
Wow that is MY mayor and I am proud just thinking about this fact
