 Great reporting Mr. Ripp. Anyone paying attention can see that the developers are still running the asylum. Fairhopers are adversely affected by new developments in Daphne because it puts more cars on 98 leading to Interstate Ten. Fairhope drivers play second fiddle to Daphne drivers. One day soon folks are gonna wake up and realize we let too many people onto the eastern shores.
