 Totally agree that it can be managed but Fairhope can not do anything about the growth of Daphne or other municipalities. AND Fairhope will never be a Seaside. There has been a Master Plan, an updated Master Plan, then updated again. The Master Plan is not worth the paper it has been written on if it is not followed. 

You can't slap words on a Master Plan then one day try and enforce it. Nor can you enforce a Master Plan when it is against the laws of the state.

This new administration has been in office now for what, 9 months? No plan, no strategy just spend, spend, spend and spend more on this, on that! 

Nothing from her or her sidekick. Ripp, people like me should have you looking hard at QKFF and her corruption, but you only look at those that have built this city. 

Your hypocrisy has no bounds.
