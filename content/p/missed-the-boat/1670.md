 Fairhope already has some Section 8 housing.  If you haven't noticed, Fairhope is not a large city, has little or no public transportation and has few jobs available for uneducated workers.  Additionally, Section 8 housing always becomes run down quickly because those with no ownership interest do not take care of property.  This is why Fairhope and most other cities would prefer to have owner-occupied housing as much as possible.  Why would anyone who couldn't afford the rent want to move here anyway?
