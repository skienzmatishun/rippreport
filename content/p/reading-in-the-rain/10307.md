 Hey Ripp
I got a robocall from Fairhope telling me to stay off the road and anyone “caught “ on the roads will be asked to return home
First, we are not children being told to go to our rooms
Second, I have yet to see the power line people out working
Third, if we have to go out and take care of our families we will and the city can go to hell.   This is Wednesday night and I have not seen the electric people fixing wires.  I will wait until tomorrow to see    Daphne had their guys working g salty Thai morning. What the hell were our Fairhope Powder Puff Power people doing?
