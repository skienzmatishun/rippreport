This is Jackâ€™s way of covering his ass with his hand picked attorney. For years the city has talked about a full time city attorney. Not Jack. He does not care about what it cost the city as long as he is in control.

Jack may get more than he wished for Friday, and he deserves it.

Wake up Fairhope, especially the women. Burrell is a bully and his antics are costing Fairhope taxpayers and has had a demoralizing effect on city employees.

FREAKY FRIDAY WILL BE FREAKY
