 Why should we pay tolls on an interstate?   They are called FREEWAYS for a reason 
I say no tolls even if we have to stick with a backed up
Bayway.   Those people that bought the cheap houses
In the cheap Cox subdivisions must pay for their ooor decisions or at least protest at the Cox Compound
at the foot  of Bellrose in Daphne
Oops, Cox, I ratted you out again.  Well I may be the few that you do not own.
