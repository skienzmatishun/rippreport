The infrastructure failures in Fairhope are directly connected to Jack Burrell and his lackeys.

Doesn’t it make you feel more confident knowing Jack is “speaking for the people of Baldwin County.”

Jack is all for the toll’s and “increasing the county’s soaring population”.

Just what we need while infrastructure failures and sewage in the bay are daily occurrences.

“Speaking for the people of Baldwin County, Burrell noted the new bridge and Bayway could increase the county’s soaring population growth and definitely boost business. Anytime you make the transportation easier it could potentially have that effect,” Burrell said, “Depending on where you stand, if you ask a lot of people in Baldwin County they may want to say, ‘Let’s put up a fence and not allow new people to move in,’ but there’s a lot of people that invite that business. The business community will invite that flow.”

If Jack’s nose keeps growing the bridge will need another lane.

“Fairhope infrastructure is 10 years behind. Jack Burrell has been on the council 10 years and kicked the infrastructure can down the road. He was directly involved in slowing down or not even approving projects. A true politician, Jack now talks about infrastructure, what B.S.“

Burrell first promised no federal money was needed, and no tolls.

If his mouth is moving he is lying! NO TOLLS.

Burrell is the last person you should, EVER, believe:

I hope you read the above and understand Burrell is a consummate liar. He is the political mouthpiece representing Baldwin County and his job is to support tolls and development, while pretending that the population of the county is all warm and fuzzy and are now supporting tolls.

Sleep tight Baldwin County, Jack Burrell is speaking for YOU.

EVERY POLITICIAN WHO LIED TO US ABOUT NO TOLLS SHOULD BE VOTED OUT OF OFFICE
