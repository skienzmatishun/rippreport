With the death of a beloved member of the Bay Minette Community shot dead after a 10am traffic stop one month ago, the people of this small southern town in Alabama have created the Bay Minette Justice League. Scott Johnson's article in the Lagniappe Newspaper is all about the narrative fed to the press by the Baldwin County Major Crimes Unit, a fiction of Sheriff Huey Mack's imagination that has a long history of cover-ups and disinformation.

What do: 1) Uvalde Texas 2) the death of Jonathan Victor along I-10, 3) Robert Yates losing his life over an eviction at Key Largo Villas mobile home park south of Fairhope 4) North Baldwin County and the death of Peyton Little (19) who was a confidential drug informant for the Baldwin County Drug Task Force (a detail never disclosed to the BCSO Deputy investigating his death) 5) the death of five people in a wrong way pursuit on I-10 6) the malicious prosecution of Mobile County Commissioner Steve Nodine, and 7) the conviction of Forest Bullin of the attempted murder of Baldwin County Sheriff's Deputy Michael Walker all have in common? Watch and find out.
