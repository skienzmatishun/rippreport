In Bay Monette, residents fear police overpatrolling, especially on Hickory and Clay Streets, where increased patrols and surveillance have sparked concerns of intimidation. A 25% crime drop and resident praise are cited by Chief Al Tolbert, though complaints persist. In 2018–2020, Bayman police income from fees and forfeitures surged 640% to $1.2 million—half the town’s total income. On August 20, 2023, Otis French Jr., a 2008 Baldwin County High graduate and Alabama A&M marketing graduate known for his faith, music, and peaceful nature, was pulled over for a tail light issue in a gray vehicle parked on Lower Street. He refused to exit the vehicle despite no arrest, and after being pushed to the ground and chased, used a taser multiple times before being shot. The incident, occurring at 10:30 a.m., remains under review by the Baldwin County Major Crimes Task Force, which is analyzing shell casings, body camera footage, and witness accounts. The Bayman Justice League, led by Joshua Brown and Sam White, demands transparency and justice, highlighting that Bayman’s population of 8,107 includes only 865 registered voters—emphasizing civic neglect. French, known for his non-violent history (only a 2016 dismissed resisting arrest charge), was portrayed as a peaceful man, contradicting police claims of armed resistance and attempted flight. The officer, now on paid leave after joining from another department, has not been identified. 

The incident sparked community outcry, with the Baymanette Justice League challenging the official narrative as misleading and mischaracterizing French. Sheriff’s Commander Andre Reed, in an August 22 press conference, promised an independent investigation but refused to release body cam footage, calling it manipulable, and denied media access to the grand jury, which reviews officer justification and operates in secrecy. A surveillance clip shows officers waiting 48 minutes in a hallway before entering a room—contradicting the Texas Rangers’ claim of a swift response. The pattern of narrative distortion mirrors the Uvalde, Texas mass shooting, where facts shifted daily, undermining public trust. Similar misrepresentations occurred in the Robert Yates and Jonathan Victor cases: in Yates, 114 rounds were fired into a mobile trailer; in Victor’s 2017 I-10 shooting, he had no weapon, only a jacket and fanny pack. Despite being unarmed, Victor was charged, and deputies armed themselves, yelling commands while he refused to drop items. After four shots, Victor was resuscitated five times and died eight hours later. A two-minute body cam clip and witness recording were released, but with minimal context—only that Victor failed to comply. First responders had warned each other over the air about the sheriff’s arrival, not the threat, and the press claimed ketamine was found in Victor’s report, later revealed to be administered by paramedics. 

In the 2010 case of former Mobile County Commissioner Steve Nodine, Angel Downs, his girlfriend, was found dead at her driveway with a 9mm pistol beside her. Nodine was seen leaving in a red county truck. Early evidence suggested suicide, but DA Judy Newcomb pursued a murder investigation in just 15 days—timing suspicious given the 2010 Republican primary. False claims of blood residue, surveillance footage, and a 40-caliber shell casing were made, later proven false by forensics. A 9-3 jury deadlock led to a mistrial, and the case was moved to Dothan. Nodine pleaded guilty to misdemeanor domestic harassment and perjury, and faced federal charges for drug and firearm offenses, serving two years in custody. In a separate domestic incident, suspect Forrest Bullen was charged with attempted murder and first-degree assault after shooting Deputy Mike Walker while responding to a call. Walker, injured and injured in the line of duty, remained alert, gave commands, and returned to full duty. The 911 call, from Forest Lewis, reported gunfire at 6:36 p.m. on Highway 59 with no lights or identification. Deputies entered without lights, a warrant, or announcement—violating evidence rules like 404B. A "master name index" of known threats was introduced by prosecutor Teresa Hinds, citing confidential informant tips. Despite no warrant, deputies entered and fired shots; a second blast hit Walker in the face. Bullen was convicted of attempted murder and domestic violence, facing 10 years each, plus federal gun charges. 

Paton Little, a confidential informant for the Sheriff’s Drug Task Force, was declared a suicide, but deputies failed to secure the scene and admitted no evidence supported the claim. Little’s handler was Chief Al Tolbert, now leading the O.J. French investigation—raising conflict of interest concerns. The official narrative that Little was a snitch is contradicted by evidence of 30 known informants. No accountability or transparency has emerged. The independent major crimes unit, chaired by Tolbert, faces criticism for a lack of impartiality. The Rip Report, a not-for-profit watchdog, continues to expose corruption, asserting the right to defend its findings against any majority or consensus.
