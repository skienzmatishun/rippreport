The Fourth of July is America's premier holiday. Reflect with friends and family on our country's great history and our unforgettable march toward independence as a nation.

Be proud you are an American.

Meanwhile...Here are Four Questions for the Fourth:

1) How is the Fairhope Airport beneficial to the City of Fairhope at a cost of $9 million and $400k annually?

2) Should the City have accepted the gift of Fly Creek Wetlands from a developer?

3) Should there be an auditing of the Soccer Fields ($6 million)?

4) Should there be an auditing of the $13 million "maintenance expenditure" on the old sewerage plant?

We will revisit these questions after the Holiday. However, feel free to chime in related on our active message boards.
