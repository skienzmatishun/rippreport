 The top of the hill on Parker Road was such a beautiful part.  I looked as if it was being developed nicely with Poser Forms on the corner.
Now it is in the process of being ruined.  Fairhope Council you ALL will answer for this the next election!
You better get your spin machine working because what you are saying and what is happening are two different things.  Don't be surprised because you all knew you could only get away with so much until the voters got fed up with your dirty dealings.  It happened to Kant and it WILL happen to you.  You brought this on yourselves!  
Please save everybody the trouble and you the embarrassment by just not running again for the office you will be voted out of in two more years.
