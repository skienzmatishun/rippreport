The poster “Boy” of corruption in Alabama is hands down the Executive Director of Alabama Ethics Commission Tom Albritton. The Attorney General, State and local Representatives, State senators, Alabama Bar and all of Goat Hill are aware of Mr Albritton’s unethical behavior in relation to the Mabel Amos Trust. However he remains in office with a 100 thousand dollar plus salary???? Teaching ethics???


How is Albritton still in office? Millions of dollars are unaccountable from the Mabel Amos Trust.

Albritton has not provided a detailed list of all the people he rewarded with donations or scholarships. That list is Albrittons blackmail card he has used to stay in office. Politicians, lawyers, Judges and prominent people have received money and they do not want to refund the money nor their names be made public.


Albritton should face criminal charges and be dis-barred instead he is used as a pawn by our Governor to fire someone that has more integrity than both the Governor or the Ethics Director.




The Ethics Commission is a joke and Mr. Albritton is a fraud. Wake up ME MA
