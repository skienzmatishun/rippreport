 Because bubbles form and pop in less than a year.  Nothing to do with past Presidents of course.  Nothing to do with the smoke and mirrors he/they used to heat the economy.  By the way, they are splitting up the money the banks can't pay and packaging them up.  Also, Trump should be in prison.  But you probably don't believe in the constitution and the separation of powers.  The weak but strong Democrats (Textbook facist tactic you fall for 24-7).  I'm sure the weak but strong Democrats rewrote history to make Trump look bad. They put Hitler in prison too. So you'll keep worshipping Orange Jesus until you get that tyrant you've been dreaming of.  Because you only want a tyrant because it's all about you're rights. But, I say throw the traitor in prison. You'll ignore the text messages and overwhelming evidence either way. You believe the morons on your favorite rage entertainment channel.
