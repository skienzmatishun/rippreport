 With all the publicity about Catalyst you can bet in the next election that Catalyst will be under another name.  Catalyst has lost some of its glitter and stealth.
To find out what Catalyst will be called, I will look at who certain developers give their money to and who the politicians pay their money to for "political consulting."  This will illuminate the Catalyst trail. Just follow the money.
I will start by looking at the political candidates who are in non-contested races in Republican primaries and see who they are paying immediately after the primaries.  Then I will see who is donating to the campaigns.  You see, Catalyst collected AFTER the elections last time in order to hide their tracks but in the non-contested races they accelerated their collections to get the cash flow in.
I do not know what name they will use, but if I see the same name across political candidate forms, that will be Catalyst. 
Yes, Catalyst, I know you will read this and change your methods, but we dare you to fudge on SOS filing forms and try to hide too much.  We will be watching you there as well.  
You crooks have been outed.  Thanks to Ripp and no thanks to the defunct media who wonders why they are going broke.
You politicians who use Catalyst will be known for being sell outs and crooked as well.  Use Catalyst at your own peril....
