Read these articles and you will see why Alabama is head over heels, above any state, when it comes to political corruption. What makes it worse is the small minded press in the state. Journalist in Alabama appear to only cover certain news. They favor their own commentary and shy away from news “scoops” from another local news source. They are ignoring the elephants on Goat Hill.

Where is Kyle Whitmire, John Archabald, John Sharp?

Where is the Alabama political reporter? What about the Jeff Poor show? Why is his mic off?

What about all those TV stations that brag about exposing corruption?

In any other state these stories would be front page. Not in Alabama, that is why Alabama is so corrupt. The absence of press contributes to the corruption.

Please read these articles, the links are open. The Attorney General, Ethics Commission and Alabama Bar represent the top shelf of corruption in Alabama.

>“The commission unanimously approved an administrative resolution of the case and forwarded \[it\] to the Alabama attorney general. That request has been approved by Steve Marshall, attorney general, state of Alabama,”

the records stated.

With Marshall punting on the possibility of any criminal investigation of McCallum’s behavior, the Ethics Commission meted out fines for his various transgressions.”

>“If I had to bake an “Alabama Corruption Cake” the recipe would probably go something like this: 2 parts shiftless opportunists, 2 parts complicit appointed boards and agencies, 1 part disinterested Attorney General’s Office, 1 part ineffective Ethics Commission and 2 pinches of one-party rule. Blend thoroughly, bake for 200 years and ice generously with inept and partisan press coverage. Serves 5 million.

Needless to say, all of this is made worse by the fact that the State Bar is run by lawyers who are supposed to know and follow the law. McCallum’s behavior not only appears to have been swept under the rug by the attorney general (lawyer), Ethics Commission (run by a lawyer) and the State Bar (lots of lawyers), he received zero punishment from the State Bar.”

“The Ethics Commission’s Executive Director, Tom Albritton, has got a pass from the Ethics Commission, Alabama Bar and the Attorney General. The only recourse for any justice is to file a civil suit against Mr Albrittion the trustees and the bank. This is blatant in your face corruption, at the highest level of our state’s government.”

>“Albritton was confirmed by the State Senate as executive director of the Alabama Ethics Commission in March 2015, and that same year, two of his children received $15,000 scholarships to the University of Texas from the trust, according to 990 records. Overall, scholarships to Albritton’s children totaled $105,000 between 2014 and 2018, which is the last year for which the trust’s 990s are available, so it is possible there was more scholarship money distributed to them.”

Ask yourself WHERE THE HELL IS THE PRESS?
