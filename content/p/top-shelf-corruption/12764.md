 Ripp, there is no press
The Mobile Press Register is too busy selling Show Station ads
Gulf Coast Media is too busy sucking up to local city and county politicians that all you get is Local Fluff 
The TV stations are too busy chasing shootings and more puff pieces
In other words there is no media.  There is just narratives that  butt kissers and activists chase
Shoot, that guy who wrote for Gulf Coast Media and the Baldwin Insider - you called him Chucky Cheese - was just a shill for Catalyst.    His reward was that he got a job with the state delegation.   
Chucky Cheese worked hard to get his cushy, do-nothing job.
Like you said:  “Bend over, again.”
