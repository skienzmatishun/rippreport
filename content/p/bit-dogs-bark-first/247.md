 Has everyone forgotten that as of right now, the city doesn't have an approved budget? As far as hiring an administrative assistant, Ms. Wilson HIRED an assistant BEFORE the position was approved under the assumption that she could do so quoting a Jefferson County resolution. At the very least, there should be a budget in place before a position is CREATED, much less hired for. Not only that, but the job was not posted as required by law. She has already chosen who she wants to hire. Several times stating "this person I want to hire..." , before the POSITIONS had ever been created or approved. Seems the "good ole boy" system (as you call it) has simply changed hands.
