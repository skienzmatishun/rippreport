 Jimmy Conyers is the only council member living up to his campaign pledge! 
Brown needs to post his comments regarding city council meeting...  The citizens need to know where he stands on these issues.
If a council member misses a meeting- I believe they need to submit their remarks prior to missing the meeting. 
Also- how can they change the engineer company during a work session and not give the citizens notice.
What happens if the CITIZENs want to say why the wouldn't want HMR to do the study. Maybe HMR has been the engineer on record where neighborhoods are having problems!.... 
They are not FRESH EYES....
