 Then again Paul Ripp has lied in his report. He asked Mr Boone if had any affiliation with a LLC with Volkert "NOT ANY OTHER ENGINEERING COMPANIES." as stated in RIPP report. Mr Boone replied he does not have a LLC with Volkert or anyone with Volkert. Mr Boone never had any affiliation with Preble Rish or any LLC with Preble Rish. Preble Rish was not even considered on the contraversial decision who to hire as an engineer to provide the sewer system study.  The15 projects Ripp said Preble Rish had on the last agenda was not City of Fairhope engineering projects. Preble Rish was representing private clients with the planning commission. Paul Ripp is a miserable man who has a talent for non factual journalism.
