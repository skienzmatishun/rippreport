34,700,000 SARS-COV-2 cases in the USA with 612,125 deaths. The Delta variant of Covid-19 has hit Baldwin County hard as you will hear from a local business owner who was not vaccinated pleading with others on social media from her hospital bed before being life flighted to UAB.

The Baldwin County School System is going to require masking for 2nd-12th graders and all staff, backlashes erupted at the meeting.

We are also experiencing a heatwave and an advisory was issued for us all to ignore.

The Alabama Ethics Commission is the subject of the Lagniappe Mobile Newspaper's editorial this week by Rob Holbert. The trial of Limestone County Sheriff Mike Blakely (since '83) finally got some bad press for the legal irregularities that have occurred in the case already; we'll keep our eyes on this one.

There was another suspect barricaded in a car on the Interstate this week just North of Bay Minette, everyone surrendered. Another case being looked at by the BCSO Major Crimes Unit is the shooting death of a suspect in Spanish Fort last week, some 80 rounds fired at the suspect's vehicle. Mums the word.

Mo Brooks wears body armor to the Jan 6 rally in DC?

And AG Marshall and your Mee Maw want the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade (highly unlikely).

Mobile has some great plans for the old Civic Center, the problem is the WILL. And our old pal Tim James steps back into the fray calling out Gov Ivey for scalding the unvaccinated.

In other news another Bridge onto Pleasure Island is in the works, no word on how much the bridge will cost nor the previously discussed prohibitions in the Foley Beach Express Contact that prohibit such a bridge being constructed. Details.
