 Regarding closing the golf course by the Mayor is true, it’s also very clear to me that Burrell could have and should have already opened Quail Creek already. While the Mayor certainly did the right thing at the time. Both parties could have see what some other golf courses have chosen to do to have a safe and open course to the public. I’m not quite sure why Burrell didn’t open back up the course when he could have?   I can only guess that when asked a couple of weeks ago about opening it, he said “I’m not going open Quality Creek, I’m gonna to let the Mayor get blamed for the course being closed”. WOW!  As many golfing buddies that Jack has, I’m surprised that he wants to screw them out of their enjoying playing golf while trying to make the Mayor look bad. What sorry ass person Jack Burrell is to do this. Could have been a hero and did the right thing by opening Quail Creek himself but chose to not let us play golf simply to try and hurt the Mayor. Well Jack, you truly are a jackass. Go back to where you came from Jack because it’s certainly not Fairhope!!!
