 OK now, you guys keep badmouthing Sheriff Hoss Mack.  He will sick his boys on y'all as well.  He is the most popular elected official in Baldwin County.
He earned my respect back during the Scandemic when Gov Mee Maw said if people were not wearing the sheeple masks that they would be arrested.  Hoss said he would not enforce her edict as it was not law.
You fearmongering folks like to try to keep stuff stirred up.  How is it working for y'all?
