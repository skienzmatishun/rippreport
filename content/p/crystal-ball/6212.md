 Catalyst owns the county and Fairhope is just a piece of it.
Next we will have Catalyst mouthpiece Armstrong to take the place of Davis as Davis moves up to county level.
Elliott is moving up to the state level.  
Do you see the growth of this cancer?   They have infiltrated the county Republican Party.  
Here is how you treat cancer:  with chemotherapy and radiation.  Yes this is poison but it runs the cancer out of the body
How does one treat the Catalyst cancer?   Vote for the Democrats running against Davis and Elliot.   Yes they may be poison to us Republicans but we must stop the cancerous growth in our Republican Party that Catalyst has infested and stolen from us.
Besides they are  better people than Elliott and Davis even if they are running as Democrats.
