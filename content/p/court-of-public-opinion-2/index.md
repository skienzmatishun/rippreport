The Executive Director of the Alabama Ethics Commission, Mr Tom Albritton should resign his position. His failure to do so will only further erode the little trust Alabama citizens have in the Ethics Commission.

If you are not familiar with this case please read this article first:

{{< socialpreview url="https://www.lagniappemobile.com/news/local/self-dealing-ethics-director-s-kids-tuition-paid-from-trust-he-oversees/article_21349d0e-7f2e-5a35-924d-9d3d9250cfa2.html" >}}

"While the parts of Mabel Amos‚Äôs will that established the trust appear to give great latitude to its three trustees in terms of making expenditures and selecting scholarship recipients, it does contain very strict language against ‚Äúself-dealing‚Äù by trustees."

‚ÄúThe trustee shall not engage in any act of self-dealing as defined in section 4941(d), and shall not make any taxable expenditures as defined in section 5489,‚Äù it reads.

The above, is no concern of the ethics commission nor is it relevant that Mr. Albritton is an attorney, or trustee for a trust, he has ‚ÄúSelf Dealed‚Äù his family, $120.000.00, so far.

This is the response from the Ethics Commission, General Council

The Alabama Ethics Commission forgot what the definition of Ethics's is:

Ethics is based on well-founded standards of right and wrong that prescribe what humans ought to do, usually in terms of rights, obligations, benefits to society, fairness, or specific virtues. ... "Being ethical is doing what the law requires." "Ethics consists of the standards of behavior our society accepts.‚Äù

Should this not be the foundation of the Ethics Commission? Or is it their position, interpreting the law in a manner that avoids accountability and rewards corruption. The Ethics Commission is aware of the scope of the complaint, however they choose to hold their noses and look the other way in the face of Mr. Albrittons, admissions.

For the Ethics Commission to allow Mr. Albritton to remain Executive Director, would be tantamount to aiding and abetting political corruption in Alabama.

The Ripp Report also filed a Alabama Bar complaint against Mr. Albritton, below is Mr. Albritton's responce to the Bar addressing my complaint.

The Ripp Report will respond to the letter Mr. Albritton submitted to the Bar and post it. Mr Albritton's letter is a sad comentaryof his interpertation of has actions. His omessions of certain facts will be corrected.

Mr John Bell, Regions Bank and Rick Clifton are the other two trustees, they should account f r any "scholorships"that they, or their friends, have recieved. What about employees of Regions Bank? The trust should have a forensic audit. I bet Mr Albritton is not the only trustee to use the trust as their piggy bank.

How did Conecuh County citizens not know about the discovery of oil. Did the county get any taxes or royalities? Where was the Conecuh County Commission?
