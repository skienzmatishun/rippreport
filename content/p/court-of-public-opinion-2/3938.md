 The court of public opinion is now in session.

Observations from the court room: Jack appears worried. Said he has not bothered to get an attorney. Meanwhile, he gets his catalyst pals to run interference on the ripp report board.

It looks like the facts are finally beginning to settle in with the Fairhope Five. 

Their days on the council are numbered. 

Meanwhile, there is still no budget. Crap still floats in the bay. More turds are flowing than ever thanks to the overdevelopment.  Smart growth. Right.

Soccer complex is bringing in millions...in outgoing payments...still not a single soccer tourney there. That's because it's a glorified practice field...UNLEVEL.

Hint: Your city council members are also not on the level.
