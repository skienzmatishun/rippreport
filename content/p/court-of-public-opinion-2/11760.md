 Great. Someone threatening to kill an elected official.  Guess we don't do voting anymore. Oh, but not him, other people will kill him.  It's starting to be a familiar theme.  Maybe there is no "big army". Just a bunch of cowards thinking people will kill for them.  All that's going to happen is a bunch of domestic terrorism on innocent people.
