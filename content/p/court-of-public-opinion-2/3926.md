 You should read the resume of the attorney Ripp hired. What a joke, 2 DUI's, one in 2011 and another in 2015, and the attorney was defeated 2 to 1 in city council seat he held for the past 30 years. Well, not completely true, he was removed from the council in 2011 for missing 90 days straight of council meetings was remove but reelected. Ths gentleman that Ripp has hired was fired as city attorney of Alabaster too. Oh, and Morris has admitted he is an alcoholic. Yeah, Ripp found someone to take a case that will not make pass go, this case is a farce. He graduated the high powered law school of The Birmingham School of Law, the school is not ABA accredited. But hey, you are who you hire!
