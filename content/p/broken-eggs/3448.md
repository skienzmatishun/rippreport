 Tim Kant was Corte's bitch;  Kant has been replaced by Robert Brown, who now owns Boone &amp; Burrell b/c they all have so many skeletons in their bars.

  I have NO sympathy for Boone &amp; Burrell, but I feel sorry for Brown and his family....he does not appear to be very intelligent and I think that he is caught up with being 'in charge' of something.

 Jay Robinson began his Council term making stupid remarks, but he has grown up and into his position.  How I wish that Brown would do the same.

  Go back and watch the video of the last Council meeting where Brown states that 'the Council' are the only votes that matter as to  impact fees and how they are spent. He was the only Council member who had issues. What is he hiding?  His head is bigger than Kant's stupid flower clock!

I understand that he is selling his home. Who wants to bet that a Corte buys it for a massive gain to Brown?  Fairhope is toast if Brown is a crook......fingers crossed that I am ill-informed.
