 I believe there will be indictments. However, for as many years as we have had to deal w an unethical Ethics Commission, and a city attorney in bed with all these Fairhope scoundrels...it is a pure blessing we have gotten this far...and this all never would have come to the light of day if Kant were still in office. Thank you, thank you, thank you Mayor Karin
