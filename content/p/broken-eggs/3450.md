 The soccer complex isn't finished from what I heard. But, it does look subpar. I was expecting something nicer for the price tag. I heard that because the fields are not level they will not be allowed to host tourneys. This is why they were built to attract sports tourism like Foley.

Foley must have smarter politicians and people.
