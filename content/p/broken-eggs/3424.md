 Is there reason to believe that the Committee is dishonest?  I don't know anything about the Members or how they were selected,  but I would bet that no one with any assets would accept these positions if they had less than stellar intentions to do the best for Fairhope and Mobile Bay (that includes Fly Creek).

 I was also so happy to hear that the State Attorney General's office is beginning to pay a good bit of attention to our little cesspool!

 Can you imagine that, if anyone on this Committee has ulterior motives, how high their damages could go or how long their prison sentence could be?  Hell has no fury like a woman who cannot allow her children to swim in her backyard  bay!

The 3 B's are toxic waste......can we not get a petition and remove them from office?  I am all for being fair, but Monday night sent a clear message.......even if Boone &amp; Burrell don't agree with Brown, they will vote with him (and vice versa).
No tax paying citizen deserves to be represented by this little coward coalition.
