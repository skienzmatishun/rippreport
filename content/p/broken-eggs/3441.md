 I live near the soccer complex. One neighborhood over, off 44. I rode by on 13 daily when they constructed the new fields.  First of all, the property was not level to begin with. It was undulating plain with a high side and a low side. The SUMMIT contractors (written on their white work trucks) had to haul in hundreds of loads of dirt in an effort to level the fields.t 

So, first of all, they chose to build soccer fields on uneven ground and then brought in their own dirt to level it.  This cost extra money. They then had to pay the bulldozer folks to grade it out, and make the fields. This went on for weeks. The task of leveling the fields are difficult, as they are placed at different levels. I don't know if the engineers knew they had to be level for tournament play, but they ignored that fact and delivered a sub-par, practice field complex without locker rooms for $6.7 million.

SUMMIT is owned by Clarence Burke. Fyi. 

There were sub contractors on the job also. I think the entire thing stinks. No one ever cared about the fields and the kids. It was all about the contract.
