 No one knows the real price tag. It was a good ole boy deal in the middle of a real estate recession, and we paid top dollar for a piece of land with a 22% slope, for future sports. I guess maybe down hill skiing? More money is trying to be raised now to try and finish the project. It is estimated at 5 to 7 million, INSANE! taxpayers should demand forensic audit of money and contractors.
