 Amen on the soccer fields. County Commissioner Tucker Dorsey had one of his LLC companies deliver some dirt. They all can go to hell as far as I'm concerned. Level is meant for ANY type of work or building. Soccer fields, out houses, barns ( my granddaddy leveled his dirt where he built a barn!) so I ask you why???  With all that money spent, even more than the 6.7 you mentioned, we have a crappy soccer field where no one can conveniently eat and certainly can not spend the night. As I was driving past last night about 8pm. I noticed the parking lot (the inadequate parking lot) had all the lights on. How much is this costing us per night when no one at all is even in the parking lot and the lights are off on the fields.
