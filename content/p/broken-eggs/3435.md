 This site is a good start for people to hear about some of the things going on in this town, however,  if you are interested in getting rid of the scoundrels then start showing up for the City Council meetings and get up and walk to the podium and start asking questions and being a citizen of this town then tell them how you feel about what is going on and exactly what you expect them to do. Is it too much to ask the Mayor and City Council to take care of the business of the city ??  It is raining heavy right now at my house and I am thinking about the sewer problems in Fairhope.  We as citizens could not care less about which one of them has the last word or has control of someone else and can make the other one look bad. THAT IS NOT WHAT THEY WERE ELECTED TO DO!!!!
