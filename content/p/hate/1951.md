 I agree with much of what you've said.  However, I feel that because the council has fought against the mayor every single day since she took office, I'm not sure I know what exactly you blame her for.  And I don't want to be argumentative, but what exactly has she done that you are you unhappy with?  So far, but for the dissension between council and mayor it seems she has been working toward what most of the residents including me elected her for.  If the council would stop throwing roadblocks in her way she'd have probably accomplished a lot more.
