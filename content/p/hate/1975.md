 Wow......who are you people?  I voted for Brown. I assumed that he was against the apartments b/c he was from Fairhope and was raising a family here.  I did not notice the fact that his biggest backers were the Corte family........that was my mistake.  I am not saying that it was a mistake to vote for Brown.  The jury is still out, in my opinion.  So far, I am not disappointed. He appears to take a very thoughtful approach.  Let's not throw him beneath the bus just because he sees that the Mayor has made poor choices.  The truly frightening thing here is that I saw the humor in the American Pie/Don McLean 70's references and now I am being accused of having no morals.  
The Mayor and the Council MUST figure this out; otherwise, can we accept all resignations next month?  Let's get a new Council/Mayor!
