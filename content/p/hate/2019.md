 I have lived in Fairhope twenty years. From "The North." I see a Fairhope much larger than it was when I got here. I see a government that was dictatorship for twenty years trying to become a democracy under Mayor Karin. I see the "Good Ole Boys" worried they will lose their golden egg in Fairhope. I sure hope we can fix our infrastructure before the developers drain all the quality of life we have left. It's so different now. I had hoped to leave my house to my kids and that they would consider living here one day. Now I'm not so sure. saddens me but fairhope is on the wrong track. anyone can see this.
