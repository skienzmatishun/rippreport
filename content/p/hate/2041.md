 I agree that the growth is getting out of hand.  The streets are clogged, the stores are sold out, and you cannot even get a doctor because they are so booked up.  The county commission and the city councils keep letting these developers drop hundreds of houses in subdivisions that overwork the sewers, roads, schools, hospital, and crowd out services for those that live here.
But when real estate people pay your campaign, you let them do whatever.  Then when our home is trashed, the developers move on to another place like the predators they are.
Fairhope is turning into DeKalb County, Georgia.  We can not blame it ALL on the politicians but ourselves who elected them too.
The bickering that we see in the City Council meetings is just secondary to the fact that certain people want to make a buck and somebody is trying to stop them.  The airport is a toxic site and must be closed down if it cannot pull its weight.  You listening Burrell &amp; Boone?  No, you aren't you are too busy trying to count the money that you are going to make through some back door...
