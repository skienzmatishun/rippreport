 I think the city also donated money. Single tax refused to be the contractor as well as the city. Ultimately the soccer club became the contractor. those funds should be accounted for and the contractors reviewed. Robert Brown is on the soccer committee ask him to agree to an audit. Beware of the Jester.The soccer fields required about 1 to 1.5 million in excavation and fill.The fill and excavation would have gone down dramatically if they simply drop the elevation on one end and grade to the other. The whole deal from purchase to the grade of land and the high price paid in the middle of a recession stinks. One to Two million was wasted on graft and poor planning.
