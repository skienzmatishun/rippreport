 Nope, not a hater at all - I am a realist.  So many that live in Fairhope for years have been given a bunch of bullshit - excuse my French - they have been threatened etc to what goes on if it gets out - I know of one whose residence was broken into &amp; manuscripts stolen as they were fixing to expose what was going on in Fairhope!!!
