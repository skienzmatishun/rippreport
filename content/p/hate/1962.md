 Jester, it sounds less like Ripp is the one who is upset and more as though you are. In fact, you sound paranoid.  If you are not Robert Brown (and who here really believes you are not at this point), then why don't you come clean and tell us all who you really are.  Wait...you would never do that.  Because the things you've said, the lies you've told, the accusations - unfounded, slanderous - would shame you.  Would shame your family, as it should.  Would embarrass you in front of your friends.  I look forward to the time when all of us finally know the truth.  No one should say the things you've said and be able to continue to hide.
