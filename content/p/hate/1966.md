 The accusations? Oh my, just look at the blog. This is the problem with all of this, Ripp said it best "...due to the comments and clues if they are wrong please immediately.. say who you are that all the people..."  People think they are all detectives and they hear something, then they hear somethings else and then they take these "clues" and make these accusations! I don't care if the mayor files an ethics complaint if she feels compelled do so them so be it. I think if she feels compelled to file something then she should file something but for this blog to state what they think is the outcome before there is an outcome is wrong. But sports fans, look at what is going on in the mayor's office. Look at the article in the paper today...it is always something that has to do with trust, retaliation. The only thing my family would be ashamed of is the fact I give this blog my time, but if you want gossip it is the best mill outside of the hairdressers. I learn more gossip from this blog and when I get my hair cut than anywhere else. This blog is supposed to be about public corruption, but it is about is blaming good people for making the best decisions they know how to make and that includes the mayor! So with that being said,
I don't give a Ripp what you think!
