 Are there more than one or two of you who believe that Jester is Brown?  Seems a huge stretch to me. Brown is very low key. He may side with developers but we knew that before we voted for him.  I am not thrilled with the Council, but I think that this is approaching libel to accuse Robert Brown of posting these comments. I would be very careful here......also, I believe that Jester could possibly be a 'shut-in' who does nothing other than post on the 'net.  However, Jester does have a bead on what is actually happening here, so I do have a bit of respect for his insight and wit!  I enjoyed his American Pie references.
