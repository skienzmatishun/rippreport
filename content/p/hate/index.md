The mayor tried to mediate the impasse the council and her office are experiencing by suggesting the hiring of an attorney to represent the mayor, to mediate with the council's attorney. This is a common practice and is the way the city of Mobile handles similar situations. The threat of a lawsuit only arises if the council refuses and continues to obstruct the mayor. The council refused; however, when it came to “come fly with me” Burrell, when his plane was caught in an ethics investigation, the airport authority approved funds to hire an attorney for Jack. This is the council's definition of FAIRNESS. Take note.

{{< socialpreview url="https://rippreport.com/p/help-fairness-killing-us/" >}}

Politics invites dissent and debate and has led to more than one war. Our democracy depends on free speech, which is something we should cherish. What is now going on in the Fairhope is not free speech, debate or democracy. It is hate. While your children are being taught in school and church about bullying or cyberbullying, sexism, and how to love instead of hate, some in Fairhope have nevertheless turned to Hate. The degree of vile, nasty and personal attacks on Mayor Wilson and her family and friends are not politics. These are personal and meant to hurt people’s feelings while weaponizing distrust among the community. The saddest part is that the people responsible are long time “entitled” residents who all went to school together and played together growing up in Fairhope. Today their jealousy and selfishness is dividing Fairhope while the council shows no leadership.

The Ripp Report message board has for months received comments from JESTER 666. In the beginning the Jester seem like some sick joke; however the Jester has morphed into everything that you DO NOT want to see in your children and community. The level of hate and sexism accompanied by baseless commentary has increased to a point that the Jester and his supporters need to be exposed.

WHO IS THE JESTER ? View his comments:

> July 2, 2017 10:17 pm I guess Nix and Kant did a great job, people moved here. This mayor is clueless, she was down in Miami at the NATIONAL mayor’s conference and sign a pledge for a Bloomberg contest. The submission she needs to get a plan for Fairhope, stop talking and get something done. She is big on ideas and low on performance! Get a plan in place for Fairhope mayor!
> 
> June 24, 2017 10:21 pm LOL…the council makes about $1,000 a month for all the bs they have to deal with. The council members have a paying job outside of being a council member. Unlike the Queen that loves to spend our money! I hate to break the news to you, there has been sewage in the bay for years, and years. It is like all cities, just asks all the Tallahassee Florida residents how much sewage flow down the Chattahoochee River when Atlanta flushes. I hope this is not new to you, have you been living under a rock!
> 
> June 24, 2017 4:21 pm No, Robinson is trying to explain to the citizens the reason he is voting for something. He is articulate, smart, well read and he can spell. Queen Karin the First of Fairhope is the one that talks, talks, and talks, uh, oh, well, I am trying to explain, you know what I mean, uh, well, I am not sure, it’s the council’s fault, it’s the media’s fault, it is the employees fault, it is certainly not my fault. She has had 100 complaints, that is less than half-of-one-percent of the population. It seems QKFF can not even get her public disclosures forms correct, 2016 she had 3 siblings, and in 2017 she has only 1 sibling, huh. Sends a letter that has misspells, she lacks the details one would think someone would have with this “over 25 years of business experience.” And she calls this meeting! It seems those on this blog can only see things through one lens, and that is the lens of Queen Karin. She is at national mayors conference, not regional, but at a national conference where Bill Clinton is speaking. Spending OUR money! AND the mayor of New York, and the Mayor of New Orleans! If you look at the attendees, most are from larger metro cities, almost all are Democrats. Bloggers on here speak of GOB’s not accepting a woman as mayor then this mayor goes to a meeting where Bill Clinton is the speaker. Please! Yeah, she is spending our money wisely. I am out of town on this meeting, out of town on that meeting, spending money upon money. Only 4 mayors from Alabama attended this meeting, the Tuscaloosa, Bessemer, Birmingham, and Fairhope mayors are attendees. Hum! AT least the other mayor look like mayors! QKFF needs to attend a class(s) on how to make friends and influence people. Now that would be money well spent! QKFF new proclamation – if you speak out against me, I will delete your comments from Facebook. Now, I tell people that I live on the Gulf Coast and not Fairhope. That is a damn shame to feel that way too. I said it before and will say it again, what 2 mayors built in 30+ years she will destroy in 4 years. In year 2 of her tenure the city will have less on the balance sheet, then in year 3 and 4, the balance sheet will really fall. Strike Fast! Strike Hard!
> 
> June 24, 2017 10:00 pm Why should I move, we have been here for generations. It is scallywags and carpetbaggers that are ruining this town. Those of us that have been around for a while know how humble this town use to be, not a bunch people thinking they are something special. All these new people are de novo carpetbaggers and scallywags!
> 
> June 25, 2017 12:12 pm I fly solo, so not a part of any group. I just tell it like it is, and all of the Queen’s supporters can not handle the truth. I have all the time to post, it is really simple to use technology like a smartphone or other technology, you drop a line or two. It is called multitasking! Sloopy, sleazy and shady is the Queen’s tactics by placing spyware only on 7 computers, an assault charge, the hiring of non-qualified friends, now that is Sloopy, sleazy and shady. The list goes on and on. “It is a shame to have to live around these people” Have you ever read The Ripp Report? That is all this is, bashing of those that are doing their best to make decisions that are right. All everyone does is bash them. Here’s is a question, why is it that the Queen doesn’t get along with others that were born and raised here just like she was? Why is it that is seems that it is their fault when maybe the Queen needs to look herself in the mirror and stop her bs.
> 
> June 25, 2017 7:41 pm Whistle Britches and the Yankee. AND if they do track (spygate), then it should be on all of the computers not seven! Queen Karin targeted individuals for political reasons and that is retaliation! Has the Queen ever used a city cell phone or computer for personal reasons, a city vehicle to stop by and pick up something personal? How do you know what sites they visit, you are the gossip monger unless you are in the administration and now leaking inside information, the Queen is unethical and foolish. She assaulted an employee! The list goes on and on and on and on! You know it and we all know it, she in a babbling fool. She will be “one and done” “a one hit wonder” – The Queen is down spending our money in Miami trying to get photo opportunities so she can hang them on the wall and admire herself. Actually, I am a 9th generation Alabamian dumbass! You are obviously a Carbetbagger or a Scallywag. You wait and see what happens in the next election, she is done! I have stated facts! AND I don’t give a Ripp what you think!
> 
> June 26, 2017 8:15 am I don’t post for the Councilman, never have. I have seen how dangerous the Queen is. In her April town hall meeting, she said the mission statement for Fairhope now is “trustworthy leadership”. I was one of the few that showed up for the meeting. Then, Spygate occurs, the Queen is so stupid she thinks people can not see through her. She tried to explain her points but the Superintendant of Education had to intervene because she was saying – uh, well, okay, unhuh, duh, giggle, my, yes, it is this, well, do you know what I mean, oh my, well….. So, you and your supporters like to use sexual remarks to make points because you lack the intelligence, that, combined with all the whiskey you have been drinking, in an attempt to make some point. I did not vote for Kant, didn’t vote for the Queen either, didn’t vote for all the council members. The Queen does everything for the wrong reseasons. The Queen is in this for the Queen, it is all about the Queen, she somehow thinks how she is going to move up in politics to a higher officer. She is indeed making a name for herself, and that name, well, I have refrained from using language on here that is not worthy. You will not call out the mayor on the crap she pulls, you have your head in the sand, and you should be upset with all of her bs too. AND take care of your partner to get all the sexual tension off of your mind. If they will let you touch them with that mouth, I bet your mother is proud of you.
> 
> June 24, 2017 9:56 pm It will stop many to step up and serve, why would anyone subject themselves to this type of criticism! That is why we have the mayor we have, you wait and see, the best qualified will shy away from running. If not for this council, this city would be in shambles. This new economic development director, what economic development has she done? She is an overpaid PR person, she doesn’t understand economics because all she has ever done is, well, nothing. I want to see the economic impact she has brought to Fairhope. I also want to see how much the Queen is spending on her travels.
> 
> June 26, 2017 6:29 pm According to the US Census in 2010, Fairhope had 15,326 in population. And of the population, approximately 11,651 (74%) were old enough to vote. Now, using the US Census estimates for 2016, the city of Fairhope has an estimate of 19,421 population, and using the same percentages of voters (74%) this means there are a possible 14,372 voters. That means everyone over the age of 18 is registered to vote. According to the Fairhope website, in 2016 there 15,777 registered voters and of that only 6,625 voted (41.99%). If you use the above percentages, how can there be that many registered voters in 2016? Impossible! I wonder how many absentee ballots there were, and who voted for whom? Are there people on the voting rolls that need to be purged and are there people of the voting rolls that do not homestead in Fairhope or are registered to vote in two cities? If this is their second home, then they are allowed to vote but they need to be homestead, tags, taxes, ectara, etc. You can vote in national elections because the federal government does care, but the state and cities do care! Was it the absentee voting that won the mayor office in 2016? Hum….
> 
> June 27, 2017 11:35 pm You are indeed correct, it is actually “etcetera, etc.,….” I don’t cut and paste, do not have to and since this is all you can correct in my post, give me a 97%. I am glad you agree with my post! Fool!
> 
> June 21, 2017 10:46 pm This is not reporting but slanderous! So how is Fairhope going to stop the growth in Daphne? What everyone needs to understand this area is growing so they need to embrace it, plan for it and work with developers! Fairhope is not going to stop it because Daphne and other municipalities want the tax dollars. Daphne has the big-box retailers and the tax base to possibly start a city school system. Because of this tax base, Daphne can do more with less population. However, with more retail comes more population, if they build it they will come! Fairhope will never be a Seaside, Seaside was built from the ground up, Fairhope has been here a while. Fairhope needs to take advantage of 181 being widened and plan for some retail out that way, Fairhope planning area is going to grow regardless of what others may want. It simply can not be stopped, property owners do have strong property rights in Alabama. Get over it!
> 
> June 22, 2017 12:39 pm Totally agree that it can be managed but Fairhope can not do anything about the growth of Daphne or other municipalities. AND Fairhope will never be a Seaside. There has been a Master Plan, an updated Master Plan, then updated again. The Master Plan is not worth the paper it has been written on if it is not followed. You can’t slap words on a Master Plan then one day try and enforce it. Nor can you enforce a Master Plan when it is against the laws of the state. This new administration has been in office now for what, 9 months? No plan, no strategy just spend, spend, spend and spend more on this, on that! Nothing from her or her sidekick. Ripp, people like me should have you looking hard at QKFF and her corruption, but you only look at those that have built this city. Your hypocrisy has no bounds.
> 
> June 22, 2017 1:11 pm IF it were not for the city council, QKFF would destroy what it took 30 years to build, she will destroy in 4 years. June 22, 2017 9:10 pm With all the lies being spread on here someone has to bring balance to this forum. If not, then all of QKFF supporters will try and blame everything on the council. I bet the mayor’s supporters blame this bad weather on the council! Seems like I have frustrated QKFF supporters with the truth!
> 
> June 22, 2017 12:44 pm That is why the IT Technician left the city of Fairhope, he knows his hand will be raised! QKFF will be raising her right hand too! I want to the fly on the wall when she is deposed, I can see it now, “uh, well, let me see, you know what I mean, uh, oh, well, it is everyone else’s fault, not mine.” Duh, Duh!
> 
> June 22, 2017 12:45 pm Keep living that lie, just keep believing that. When you wake up, you will break out into a sweat! (response to The only elected official working for voters is Mayor Wilson.)
> 
> June 22, 2017 1:17 pm Maybe the reason you have not received a reply, perhaps the emails were intercepted by the IT department and it will take time for QKFF to read all of them before having them released to the council’s email accounts! Spygate!
> 
> June 22, 2017 9:01 pm Robert Brown is one of the best council members we have, he is smart, methodical in thought and when he speaks he is to the point. He asks the right questions and wants to do what is right for Fairhope!
> 
> June 17, 2017 8:23 pm “For the right reasons!” Not so fast! “Anyonebutkarin” is correct, just because someone is elected as a part-time council does not exclude them from doing business with the city. Nor does it exclude them from having friends that do business with the city. If it did then there would be very few people that qualify for election as a council member. Queen Karin the First of Fairhope (QKFF) would have a conflict because anything the queen proposed to benefit the downtown could benefit her business. Actually, since the mayor is a full-time position there would be more of a conflict. Individuals that are part-time are allowed to make a living and keep friends. The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled on this in the past. As far as QKFF, well, the queen has arrived, so go about your business, she is here to save Fairhope, now go about your business, my supporters know I am great and without any conflicts, go about your business. The only people that think they know are the mayor’s supporters, clueless at best! Strike Fast! Strike Hard!
> 
> June 17, 2017 10:22 pm Hurt my feelings? Yeah, I need QKFF to make a safe space, right beside the statue of her, Dean and with Ripp kneeling in front, that will placed in the circle at the pier, so those of us that get their feelings hurt can go. LOL…you make me laugh. Just look at the QKFF’s decisions, she campaigned on ending the lawsuits but she is now coming to understand that lawsuits are part of the job. QKFF likes to hide behind lawyers, lawyers that are paid with our money. QKFF doesn’t realize that the only person that wins in a lawsuit is the lawyers, and they will tell you to ‘stand your ground’ and let us litigate this because they are going to make money. Someone need to explain to QKFF on how to eat an elephant – one bite at a time. She wants to spend money on this, let us expand the golf course so more liqueur sales can occur, let the city take over the harbor, let us do this, high-speed internet, et cetera, etc. I would like to see when her sidekick is going to deliver on something tangible and just talk, talk, talk, sniff, sniff, sniff into the microphone, deflect, make excuses. Those that can not get something done points fingers, they like all these studies because they are not capable! IF it is true that our infrastructure needs $25,000,000 in repairs, don’t you think this is what we need to be focused on? I truly think she likes controversy, she ran her campaign on negativity, points the finger at everyone, then, THEN, QKFF hires her friends that are not qualified and pay them with our money. QKFF loves the attention, she craves the attention, QKFF loves to be adored by her supporters but you keep lying to yourself, keep tell yourself QKFF is doing a good job, live the lie! I believe my commentary just may be more than QKFF supporters souls can bear! Strike Fast! Strike Hard! P.S. You know when you have won the argument? When someone begins to use curse words!
> 
> June 19, 2017 11:50 pm I was not inferring that the mayor had a conflict of interest on the downtown issues but trying to point out that only a full-time politician could have one. I think Kiefer is a nice guy, but given the crap, QKFF has pulled, I just stay way for the bookstore. I am not boycotting the bookstore just choose to stay way due to the political talk around the coffee shop. I am tired of hearing the lies. QKFF has made some really bad decisions. Please tell me what her sidekick-whistle britches (WB), has brought in something tangible except sniff in the microphone and make excuses for this and that? Please enlighten me on all these tangles WB has done in exchange for this salary of hers? When the QKFF wants to spend monies on the harbor, the clubhouse, on the golf course on the salaries, I would like to see what all of this is going to cost us!
> 
> June 20, 2017 3:25 pm Ripp, I thought you were against corruption? It seems you feel like it is okay because someone you supported is now mayor! So you are okay with QKFF hiring two individuals that lack the education, WB has never held a job more than three years and in some cases, not even a year, so what successes can some have when only working in a job for a year or two? There no long-term track record. You are okay with the mayor’s office hiring friends that are not qualified and paying them some of the largest salaries within city government? So we need to stop “bitching?” Typical QKFF supporter.

> 
> June 15, 2017 2:25 pm Concur totally! I’ve yet to hear anyone that is happy with her, and I have asked so many people that vote and have not hear one good word. Many of them voted for her, they have said they are so disappointed. IF she makes it to the end of her term and decides to run again, she will not get reelected to any office again. Period! This mayor will only be transparent when it is convenient for her! She is saying she doesn’t or will not approve any settlement, but she knows it is not her call, so it sounds great on her Facebook post. She is acting like she is standing her ground but she knows that a settlement is not her call! LOL All you mayor supporters keep believing in her, she is not a truthful person! She is playing what few supporter she has left as FOOLS! Wakeup Fairhope and smell the coffee! Strike Fast! Strike Hard!
> 
> June 14, 2017 8:45 pm Mayor Wilson knows her days are numbered! The city attorney does not represent the mayor, he does not represent the city council, Tut Wynne represents the city of Fairhope! The mayor is completely clueless, she is simply ill-equipped for the mayor’s job. The city attorney does and can do an independent investigation when there is a claim filed against the city because he represents THE CITY! Her claims of not spending taxpayers money on these issues are what she is not doing, she is spending time and money. She is desperate, and her own worst enemy! My word, she really thinks she is untouchable! Complete fool! Strike Fast! Strike Hard!
> 
> June 15, 2017 2:14 pm Anonymous is calling Jester a coward again! LOL Why would I need to write a letter to the council? They are doing a good job, and if I wrote a letter to the mayor she would not read it because she is not going to listen to anyone that has good since! I have no problem signing my name – Jester Triple-Six. Strike Fast! Strike Hard!
> 
> June 15, 2017 2:36 pm When you are being investigated, you do not have a right to be the investigator! The mayor is under an investigation, the mayor is the accused and a witness, she not entitled to see anything but the final report. If she did then she would change the outcome to favor herself, and retaliate! When it is an independent investigation, it must be independent! Mayor Wilson knows what she did was wrong, she knows the truth and her supports know the truth, but they are in denial! Tut is a man of integrity and will do what is in the best interest of Fairhope, not the mayor, not the council but what is in the best interest of the CITY! Strike Fast! Strike Hard!
> 
> June 14, 2017 10:38 pm The only person caught in a trap like a rat is the mayor! Strike Fast! Strike Hard!
> 
> June 13, 2017 11:03 pm To show just how naive this mayor is “….I will not agree to pay one dime of tax-payer money (or money from the City’s insurance company) to anyone for this purpose…” If the insurance company wants to settle in an effort for limiting exposure then the insurance company will settle, should the mayor refuse to settle then the insurance company will stop defending the action and the city will be on its own! This statement alone shows just how inexperienced the mayor is! Duh, Duh! The council has to agree to pay not the mayor! Hear ye, hear ye, the queen has arrived, now move along, go about your business! I have directed the attorneys to do this, I have directed the attorneys to do that, move along, go about your business now! All you mayor supporters need to realize what you elected. AND now the council has to support in defending her because they want what is best for the city. Lord help her, please! Strike Fast! Strike Hard!
> 
> June 10, 2017 9:43 pm This mayor is so out of touch with reality; she has the personality of rattlesnake and the intelligence of an amoeba! Fake to the core! Foolish! This council with the exception of Conyers is the only thing that has kept Fairhope on the tracks, and the carpetbaggers realize this the better. Those are jealous of the GOBs need to get over it, if the city so bad with the GOBs in officer then why do all the carpetbaggers want to move here? We built it, now live with it! Strike Fast! Strike Hard! (find your own motto, do not steal this one, unless you have earned the right) June 11, 2017 9:26 pm Have I struck a nerve with these dumb mayor supports? This mayor displays all the symptoms of a paranoid schizophrenic! It’s just a matter of time for all the investigations to be finished and she will be forced to resign! She lacks self-awareness, she no emotional intelligence and has forgotten that she is an ole country girl from Alabama, that was luck she got into Auburn. She tries to make herself out to be some type of sophisticated women within the business world. She has had too many glasses of wine! Pickled mind! Strike Fast! Strike Hard!
> 
> June 13, 2017 3:01 pm If anyone would go to a city council meeting and watch this mayor who wants to spend, spend, then you will come to the realization that we are all in trouble. She now wants to take over the marina. “The study” that was done, it was done internally, by a political friend of the mayor’s, and the mayor gave her a job, then ask her to do a study that she is not qualified to do! That study was like comparing apples to oranges, I have a hard time calling it a study. You have to love the mayor’s Facebook posts! We monitor computers to ensure efficiencies…what she should have said was WE ONLY MONITOR THOSE THAT WERE APPOINTED BY KANT. This mayor is dangerous as they come because she doesn’t realize that most do not listen to her lies. She believes her own lies! NO, most companies do not spy, they may block and limit where employees search or limit sites. When you spy and you obtain personal, highly sensitive information that can only be view by few, you have a major problem. This mayor is in for a lot of issues! Kant left this city to this mayor with the strongest balance sheet of any Baldwin County city. Burrell/Bonne help build this city and she wants to change things for the sake of change – foolish as she is. Strike Fast! Strike Hard!

> June 14, 2017 11:03 pm The FSTC has been a real gift for this city. Those that do not realize this are uneducated at best, the FSTC gives so much money to this city. One would think that those that enjoy the many features here in the city would thank the FSTC! I remember the desolvation case well, and in the end, those that hold stock should be thrilled today! Estate Planning 101! Strike Fast! Strike Hard!
> 
> June 8, 2017 10:27 pm Jester is monitoring this frecency looking for targets. This place is like walking into an elementary school, most are so uneducated as to the facts that I am going climb to 8 and hold. Out! Strike Fast! Strike Hard!
> 
> June 2, 2017 5:16 pm Indeed the city has a right to know what employees are doing on the job but you cannot target individuals, if it was installed on all computers then it is permissible. Even if it was installed on all computers it will come down to what the city’s policy states. AND did they inform all the employees of the new policy. IF it was targeted, the mayor needs to resign because she has violated the federal criminal code, and if any attorney-client privileged communication, especially if the city clerk was communication with the city attorney was breached, any medical information, ecterta, etc., then someone is in deep poop! If a council member was discussing an issue the city clerk then this is really going to sting. Here’s my prediction, the IT person that installed this program will cut a plea deal and then throw the mayor under the bus and the legal system will eat the mayor alive. This is a case of altra vures, the insurance company will most likely not cover the mayor’s legal expenses. She’s done if this is true. AND here is the kicker, any and all information obtain illegally will be ruled inadmissible in court, so her efforts may have cost her the job, and she could face criminal charges, and all the dirt she has uncovered will go back into the Pandora Box, all of it. I have stated this before on here, she needed to have advisors that did not have a dog in this fight, was non-political and low key. I hate this for the city, the council, the mayor and more importantly, all of us that lives and works in this city – Carpetbaggers too! Those that were advising her really did not care about this mayor, it was all about vendettas but she will have to answer for it. I pray this all not true, I really do, we need to pray for this city. I can still remember how that music used to make me smile And I knew if I had my chance That I could make those people dance And maybe they would be happy for a while… Out

> June 4, 2017 12:37 pm So the Jester has been called out, the Jester is laughing too hard, please! WOW! HAHAHAHEHEHAHA! The only individuals on here being called out are the mayor’s supporters. The Ripp Report and his gypsies know the mayor did not have the skill set to run this city. You know this, the Jester knows this, and after the latest stunt she has pulled, now we all know this. Her supporters will try and justify this latest stunt as being appropriate, they will deflect, try and blame it on the city council, the hard working employees or the GOBs. You can place your head in the sand, but the Jester’s eyes are wide open. Here is a thought for most of you, if the mayor has installed spyware, and we have to assume the spyware was only installed on the 7 devices as reported, but it could have been installed on other devices like the email server. Or is she reading the emails off the server? What happens if you emailed a council member, and as a citizen have a concern with the mayor’s strategic plan or other matters, and she is spying on those emails too. There would be nothing confidential within the city council, the council with the citizens, the council with the city attorney, among other issues. Why would anyone participate in city activities knowing that could be retaliated against. The only person that can tell Jester to stand down is a much higher calling, no one else. If The Ripp Report wants to ‘band’ the Jester from posting, then he will silence someone that really is objective and see things for they really are! The Jester’s head on a swivel, always looking, listening and watching! It seems the Jester has placed such a strain on the mayor’s supporters that it may be more than their souls can bear! Strike Fast! Strike Hard! I met a girl who sang the blues And I asked her for some happy news But she just smiled and turned away

> June 3, 2017 8:41 am Remember when I posted the mayor extended the olive branch for a reason, she knew something bad was coming and she was going to need to the council? She ate lunch and dinner with a few council members. That was about the time she had the computers ‘tapped’, this mayor defines the term Dark Triad. She could not leave things alone, she had to ruin hard working people lives, so now, the Jester has been unleashed to start dancing! Those that know Jester, knows Jester’s abilities scares even the devil himself. Strike fast! Strike hard! Oh, and while the Queen was looking down The jester stole her thorny crown The courtroom was adjourned A verdict was returned

> June 3, 2017 3:42 pm The reason we were created was for the Marines to have heroes! Strike Hard! Strike Fast! I can’t remember if I cried When I read about his widowed bride But something touched me deep inside

> June 3, 2017 7:27 pm Ripp didn’t get Kant, Kant got himself, Kant was his own worst enemy. Kant became a politician instead of a public servant, he stopped listening to his department heads, and then he became hostage to the money brokers. The election wasn’t about who was better, both were poor choices, it was a fresh start. A start that has not happened, a start that is just like Kant’s. Hiring his friends, hiring those that are not qualified. This new mayor has harmed hard working people, people that may have disagreed with her, so she, like Kant thinks she owns the city. The public has lost total confidence in the mayor. Walk about town, a just listen! If you think really qualified people will come and work for the city, think again, especially with this spyware issue, who would want to work in that environment? If you have a disagreement with the mayor, you could be subject to being spied on! This mayor has used the playbook from a dictator! Ripp is a Marine, he knows who the real deal is! Strike Fast! Strike Hard! And while she was read a book on Marx The quartet practiced in the park

> June 5, 2017 11:39 am Why the hate? Why the name calling? Where is the hope in Fairhope? Where is the love on Monday? It is a new week, we all start out the week pleasant, right? The mayor will have Dean make a bronze statue of herself before she resigns, of course, Dean and, on one knee Ripp beside her! We all can worship these shrine in due time, there has not been enough damage yet, not enough long-term employees fired! When all the city workers have been replaced with carpetbaggers and unqualified baggers at that, then the mayor will fly a new flag and have the statue raised and placed in the center circle at the peer, that will be your last order! That way when the sky-cam of TV-15-Mobile previews the peer it will reach the maximum audience! Everyone claim down! The bronze material has already been purchased! Strike Fast! Strike Hard! Well, I know that you’re in love with him ‘Cause I saw you dancin’ in the gym

> May 31, 2017 4:23 pm Burrell is a wise man! Any astute person that is mindful knows to try and limit the liability of the city. The council has remained silent because they understand the liability these claims bring. The mayor needs to remain silent too if she can, she sometimes lets her mouth out gun her intellect, what little there is!

> June 1, 2017 7:05 pm You have to love Ripp’s stab at ‘reverse psychology’ when he publishes this so called report. I guess he thinks the junior council members are still in junior high school. Let us see if they are going to get inside the box with the rest. From reading this junk post on here, this is the most target rich environment I have ever seen.

The Jester leaves a lot of clues to his identity in his posts, some of which allude to him being a council person, most confirm a demented mind set on destruction of the mayor’s office by the use of internet bulling and slanderous and personal comments. Using an iPhone or Android phone to make such comments comes with risk of being inadvertently identified. Think about that hard JESTER 666.

In response to the mayor’s attorney addressing the council, Councilman Mr. Robert Brown choose to write a letter, to be published by Gulf Coast News, who has been assisting and supporting the attacks on the mayor by writing a series of bias articles. The GCN has never written about the airport, the “gift”, soccer field’s or ethics charges against “come fly with me”, or any controversial subject in Fairhope that involve the GOB’s. GCN has been given documents related to many issues in Fairhope by The Ripp Report, all of which they ignored. Thank God it is called the Courier and not the Fairhope Courier. The editor is drinking the same cool aid as the Jester or maybe he is flying with Jack!

Read this letter and see if you see some similarities to the Jester 666

Now is the time for the Jester or Mr Brown to step up and push back. We anxiously await their reply and denials. One thing is for sure the other comments on the Ripp Reports are free to speculate on the Jester’s identity. If Mr. Brown is the Jester, his comments reflect his mindset, that mindset is not that of a councilperson. A councilperson who calls his constituents carpetbaggers and Yankees insisting they go home if they do not agree with him and his good ole boys.

FAIRHOPE DOES NOT NEED JESTER 666 !
