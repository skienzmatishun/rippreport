 I thank you, too, Mr. Ripp.  It has to be tedious, showing up to all the Council meetings and listening to those blowhards chat among themselves like the best buddies they are (what's with "the friend of a friend who can get rid of the goose problem"?).  But just know there are countless numbers of us who appreciate what you're doing on our behalf.  You have more guts than all those council members and those in their pockets have together.
