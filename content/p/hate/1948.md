 First let me say I am not pleased with all Mayor Wilson has done since she has been in office.  But all this mess is not just her fault it is everyone on the Council as well as the Mayor.  We actually need to get rid of the new Mayor &amp; current council members.   Robert Brown could have actually reduced his letter to 1 page.  In a nutshell:  I do not like what the Mayor has done since in office so therefore I will NOT listen to anything she has to say &amp; before she opens her mouth I will not agree with what comes out of it.
    He said the ethics violations are baseless - it is not until it is over Robert Brown.  Also, were these great employees going to Kant &amp; stirring things up on the side??  It is obvious you do not know the things that have gone on for years in Fairhope.  And by the way - Nix &amp; Kant did not make Fairhope!!   The citizens &amp; business owners &amp; those that own the property is who made downtown what it is.   And believe you me - I grew up here &amp; it is NOT what it was 50 &amp; 60 years ago.  It WAS a "special" small town then with MANY businesses (contrary to what Kant has said).!!!
     All this is more than ridiculous now!!  Also,  Robert Brown is a little too cocky to me!!!
