 The crook Tripp Pittman that awarded himself $750,000 in BP money and has a tractor company. Also he left all the toxic boom anchors in the bay. How many lies have can you deal with. He paid himself with money that should have gone out to other companies that knew how to properly handle the clean up of the BP oil spill. Yet he makes up a new company and gets $750,000 for owning a tractor dealership. Wow!!!
