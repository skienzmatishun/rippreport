 Karin Wilson will never win anything again; probably, these Councilmen will all win again. I won't be voting for them, but most of Fairhope will.   I wish that we could have an election next month and replace Wilson and the Council. She is so shockingly stupid; we voted for her and gave her an opportunity to work for the good of the City, but she threw it away so that she could hire her even more stupid friends.  Makes me almost miss Kant.
