 I didn't see you today Paul! If you are going to repost my post lease get them correct, not all of those are mine. You can seem to get much right on this site correct. If ya'll missed the airshow yesterday, there was a lot of aircraft(s) flying! 

When the jester sang for Paul and Queen
In a coat he borrowed from Ole Dean
And a voice that came from you and me
