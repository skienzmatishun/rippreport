 I sure wish everyone would quit acting like assholes and get back to work. The cryptic shit is getting old. And the American Pie quotes are stupid. It seems like some are more concerned about destroying people and clever quips than they are about Fairhope. BTW..the flowers look great this year. (That was not meant to be a dig at any past, present, or future city employees. Just a compliment)
