 I'm caught again, first I am Jack, now I am Robert, everyone is so smart. Yep, caught again on here! I finally read through all of the posts you reposted, whew, so exhausting! Again, Paul if you are going to repost my post make sure they are all mine. There are several that someone else used my name. Most are mine but I can not stand when someone steals my good name and post something negative about prior elected officials. 

Now the council room air was sweet perfume
While the Jester played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance
