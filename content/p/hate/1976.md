 Yes. They all have mistakes. Do not disagree whatsoever. I'm sure we both could write out a list on all of them. I was just pointing out the fact that Brown promised to vote NO on the Fly Creek Project and this far he is not keeping his word. Said if we elected him he would OPPOSE it completely. Now for all of them.  I agree 100% with you.  If They can't work together and only fight. Let's clean the slate and start over. Can't hurt?
