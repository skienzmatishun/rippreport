 After reading your post Jester and you saying that you or your family would not be ashamed of anything that you have posted except your time that you spent on your blogging. I certainly hope that me, my fellow church members, my friends and especially my family will never have the displeasure of having any conversation or even any contact with you as long as you shall live. You are a lost and confused soul and I will pray for you as this is the right thing to do. If you and your family feel no shame for all the terrible things you have posted. I do pray that your evil postings will stop and that you might become civil in the very near future.
