 Fairhope under Kant and Nix used Planning and zoning as a tool to keep blacks out of Fairhope.  Fairhope developed a policy of not annexing any projects in their jurisdictional district. That was the president set in order to control who came into Fairhope, In Daphne a subdivision or commercial project outside city limits but in side jurisdictional district comes into the city limits as a condition for approval in P&amp;Z. This policy accepts projects or applicants without prejudice  and this also provides tax dollars for infrastructure. Fairhope ultimately screwed itself with their annexing policy and now faces a problem on how to annex. Do Not expect the council to do anything. In the 36532 area code 50% live in the city and 50% live outside city limits. Fairhope only exception was that they forced Wal-Mart by legislative action to come into city, for tax purposes, Fairhope lost about 6 million dollars by this not happening when wal- mart was approved.
