 Well Georgia.  We also had a commitment that he would vote against the Fly Creek project. Lied!  That Confirms that you don't mind backing a liar. I don't think you yourself have a clue.  I think you should be careful who you place your moral compass on. But then again you already have chosen Jester! Maybe you didn't read all the BS Jester posts shown in the article. You are a very confused person with no morals either. I hope you do not have any family that knows that you enjoy Jester's post. That would be sad. But you wouldn't care. No matter who he is.
