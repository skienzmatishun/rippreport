 What bothers me is the good ole boys are all bragging about Fairhope being the fastest growing city in the state like it's a good thing. Our high school is overcrowding by the day and traffic is getting to where it really makes you have to plan when you drive. Mayor Kant used to always say he wanted to "keep fairhope fairhope" whatever that meant! He doubled the population while he was mayor! We have to stop people. Please stop the development. We have major infrastructure problems!!!
