 I told you, Ripp, we will sign a confidentiality agreement. I can prove that I am not a council member, nor has a council member put me up to posting. I posted to prove a point, all you do is hate and when the table is turned you get upset. Now, are you willing to agree to this or not? I will prove that you and your supporters are wrong! If there was not anonymity then you have very few posts on here. Now, you said you would pay someone $5,000 if they could prove anything you state on the Ripp Report is false. You can disclose the answers to the questions and that will be that. Ripp, will you agree to this? You are trying to use reverse psychology there, "remain silent and more and more people will think you are Jester666." I really do not care, next, you will be thinking I am Jack, or Kevin or Jay or Jimmy, the list goes on and on. Are you going to honor your pledge or not?
