The Alabama House of Representatives has passed SB 46 establishing a statewide medical marijuana program. The bill now heads back to Senate for final approval.

The bill, if approved (one more time by the Senate and signed into law by Gov. Ivey), would let people with a qualifying medical condition purchase cannabis derived products after getting a recommendation from a doctor.

More than a dozen conditions, including cancer, terminal illness, depression, epilepsy, panic disorder and chronic pain would allow a person to qualify.

The bill would allow marijuana in forms such as pills, skin patches and creams but not in smoking or vaping products.

Chey Garrigan of the Alabama Cannabis Industry Association joins us for a spirited conversation about the players and the prospect of this Bill surviving the Senate.
