 I WAS THERE DURING THE RECOUNT. The boxes that the ballots were stored in were originally sealed with clear box tape the night of Aug 23.  Then two weeks later, the ballots were in U Haul boxes with duct tape "sealing" them.  The City Clerk then said that she went into the boxes because of a "court order" from the municipal judge at the order of the mayor.  SHE TOLD NOBODY UNTIL THE DAY OF TH ERECOUNT TWO WEEKS LATER.  The City Clerk is supposed to answer to the city council but she went behind the council's back at the order of the mayor with NO WITNESSES when the boxes were opened.  SHE TOLD NOBODY - NOT EVEN THE COUNCIL MEMBERS.  By the way, what business does a municipal judge have in ordering a "sealed" ballot to be opened?  Can you imagine the hanky-panky and ballot stuffing that can go on?
Do you see how smelly this is?  Daphne's election was treated like a banana republic.  The City Clerk should be fired.  If I were a Council member, I would fire her because she cannot be trusted with the council.
