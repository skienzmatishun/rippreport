 The catalyst crowd (five council people) want the citizens, citizens, citizens to vote against their own self-interests...and let the criminal enterprise continue to overbuild and ruin Fairhope's Quality of Life.

Not gonna happen Mister Ripp.
Thanks for waking up the Eastern Shore.

The Citizens Citizens Citizens will take care of it!

We are coming after you Burrell...you and your criminal cohorts
on the city council.

Criminals. You will be lucky to avoid jail time.
