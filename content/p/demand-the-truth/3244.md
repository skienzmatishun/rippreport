 You are 90% right, the marina will make money and the city should manage it. The airport fuel is suppose to be sold through the fbo however sweet heart deals allowed two select tenants to have their own fuel farms, one being Ray Hix the Board member. Now as I understand it the policy for fuel farms has changed and they will not be granted.  However Hix will keep his?, it is contrary to the fbo. Their is little or no promotion of the airport it has become a coffee club for the 1%. The city should lease it and dissolve the board, it will be better run. Burrell should be kicked off the council for his actions at the airport, if not convicted.
