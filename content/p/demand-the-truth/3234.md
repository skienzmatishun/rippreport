 Jack Burrell is not a man - he is a coward that tries to intimidate people to get his way. I do not know of anyone that respects him at all.  We the citizens are embarrassed to have him represent Fairhope in any capacity.  His behavior has gotten beyond acceptable.  His screaming &amp; smart aleck comments are beyond disgusting - and I no longer respect the other 4 men on the council for not speaking up &amp; sitting there - mostly just looking down - they have no guts &amp; are not true men either.  I do not care what their occupations are &amp; do not care what church &amp; civic organizations they are members of.  It is all for show - none of them should be representing Fairhope
