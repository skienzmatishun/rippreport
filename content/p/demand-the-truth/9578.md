 I will vote Jerry Carl.  Not I just do I want to see Jerry  ark win but I want to see a Catalyst candidate lose
I want to to be that any candidate affiliated with Catalyst, Boone, or whatever the machine wants to call itself, will lose by sheer affiliation 
If Hightower loses then Catalystâ€™s stick will go further down
