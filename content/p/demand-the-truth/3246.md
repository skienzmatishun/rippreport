 Airport title is more of a red herring. The City can retake title anytime it chooses. There were logical reasons given why taking on the title was not done. One was liability. How would you feel about a million dollar wrongful death lawsuit ? What about a ten million dollar one ?  I would certainly love for the airport to be leased out but that may be easier said than done.
If there are sweetheart fuel deals I would like to know why they were made. I thought the ones with the private fuel farms still had to pay the city
It's due,but I won't swear to that. The thing we should all be focused on are the electrical and sewer systems. They both need big $. Everyone is focused only on the sewer, hard not to, it's a bad visual, but a blackout won't go down so well either. I am for whoever will deal with this big stuff
unless they badmouth my hubby in which case, we'll let's just say there are limits. The Mayor and council are acting like they want to deal with this. I'll wait and see who does what. Paul , why don't you and Jack rent the Nix Center and have an unrecorded no holds barred debate and charge $5/person to attend ?  Maybe charge another $5/person to vote on who won. Proceeds to go to the local charity or government of your choice, all should be tax deductible.
