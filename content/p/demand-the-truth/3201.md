 I am a realtor in Baldwin County. Fairhope discussions lately (homes for sale) have gone hand in hand with questions about the sewer system. Also there has been talk about the high school being overcrowded having to use "trailers".  Fairhope has some major problems to overcome. All I can say is that these are significant impediments to locating in Fairhope. What do I tell them about dumping human feces untreated in the bay? Should I lie and say it is nothing or just quote President Burrell and say it's unavoidable and how things are done here?
