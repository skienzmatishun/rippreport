 So we now know Jack reads the Ripp Report, based on his fury about the comment made a couple of weeks ago that said he had been seen at Lulu's in a compromising situation.  True or not, I don't know.  But I know this: Jack seems to think he is the only person who has the right to go around saying things about other people that's not true. Does he honestly think that all of us here in Fairhope don't know someone who knows someone else who has heard something derogatory, inflammatory, and defamatory about the Mayor and others in her orbit, including her own family?    There are few things more enraging than utter hypocrisy and Jack has fine-tuned hypocrisy to an art.

I also want to thank you, Mr. Ripp, for speaking up during the Council meeting and not letting the bullies sway you from your right.
