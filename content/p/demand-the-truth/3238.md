 If the City took back control of the airport, couldn't the City then lease to an FBO for a lot of money?  I tried, many years ago, to lease the Destin Airport and run the FBO but was outbid by another company.  Lesson learned: we should have bid more in the beginning!

 The Monroeville, Alabama airport is leased to an FBO that does very well.  They have the Blue Angels and other training jets flying in and purchasing fuel and supplies and they are very beloved by the citizens of Monroe County because of the revenue stream that they bring.    The owner of the FBO even cooks meals for the pilots to encourage them to land and  purchase their fuel there.  The Fairhope airport is also well located;  the City could do well encouraging Military aircraft and others to stop and refuel and spend some time here.

 The Fairhope  Marina will never make a lot of money for the city, but the intent seems to be the same; if we can provide a welcoming environment to visitors arriving by water, we will create more goodwill. 
  Why is it that Burrell is the last/only word on airport matters, and who is making the money from fuel sales?  I think that the only reason that Burrell has approved the Marina deal is to divert attention from the Airport deal, but what do these 'deals' mean to Fairhope taxpayers?
