 What is the plan for the Airport? That and the Dyas triangle are generating nothing and we have major infrastructure issues that need funding. Dang, Foley is printing money, as is Daphne and all we are doing is pumping poo into the bay. Great leadership y'all, you should be proud. The City Council is an Engineer, a Builder, an Attorney, a Banker and a Moron (sorry Boone, you are) and they can't figure out how to grow the economy, fix the infrastructure and create a Fair Hope for the future? Get to work!
