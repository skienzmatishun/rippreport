 Frankly too much blather about mostly nothing. The important issue of the day was the future of the marina and the mayor had her way, desrvedly so, because her minions advanced reasonable arguments and apparently swayed at least Boone and Burrell and myself (no I wasn't physically there) . That is how things should be going instead of the hysteria, name calling, and stupid posturing. Generally her honor accomplished more this week than any I remember. I think the fighting lawsuit and the eavesdropping inquiry are both overblown since no one was really physically hurt and the it's not like the email stuff concerns national secrets.
I think the big item, dealing with the big stink, is moving along judiciously.  Hopefully the council and Mayor will go big and cough up enough $ to address the problem. The stink problem and the airport debt I lay squarely at the feet of the honorable Mr Kant with maybe a little reprimand to B&amp;B since they were there(here) for the last bit of it. BTW the big problem with the airport was paying top $ to buy all the land and stick us with a big bill. Now that the horses are out of the barn it is silly to quit paying the note and lose what we have. We are paying for the sins of the past and there are no good alternatives. Kind of like N Korea.
