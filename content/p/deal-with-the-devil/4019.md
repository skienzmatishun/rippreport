 I have several thoughts on this.
Last thought is that leaving a weathered for sale sign is poor salesmanship and shows you don't care much.
Middle thought is that this property was way too expensive and you wonder if there is under the table money and I don't mean chump change.
First thought is almost every time the (county) government gets involved in what should be private business/development it ends poorly.
Some of the things people gripe about her don't seem that big a deal. This is.
