 How else could Burrell make a living?
His engineering skills reek more than his ethics. Damn shame he is more corrupt than I ever imagined he would become. He has made millions off fairhope. Him and the council members each. It is sickening. The land deal and all the other shenanigans with judge and other local developers. Fairhope is a goner gents.
