 The infrastructure in Baldwin County is 30 years behind the times. I get tired of hearing the same excuse, "we don't have the money", or the other excuse "we never anticipated the growth" BULLS**T! We paid 10% tax on everything we buy, which is criminal. It doesn't stop the county or city from issuing building permits so they can get all that property tax. The corruption is so deep in Baldwin County and Alabama it's disgusting.
