 From City of Fairhope Ordinances: Sec. 2-36. - Permission for nonmember to address council.	
That no individual who is not a member of the council shall be allowed to address the same while in session without permission of the presiding officer and for not more than three (3) minutes, unless approved by the presiding officer.

No person, other than a councilmember or the mayor, shall be allowed to address the council on any matter which shall be the subject of a public hearing scheduled by the council until the meeting under which the public hearing on that matter is scheduled to be heard.

(Ord. No. 1479, ยง 11, 11-5-12; Ord. No. 1587, ยง 11, 11-7-16)

Presiding officer has the right to approve (or NOT) non-council members addressing the meeting.  Drop this frivolous suit already.  Does Mayor REALLY want to get into depositions???
