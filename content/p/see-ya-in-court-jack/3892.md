 I agree.  It appears that Jack Burrell and his lackeys have encouraged former employees (who were fired for cause) to sue and have guaranteed them payouts.  Burrell clearly plans to use these settlements to discredit Mayor Wilson in the future; however, I don't believe that these employees were entitled to settlements. Burrell and his boy band are raping the Fairhope taxpayers to make Jack look magnanimous to city employees.  They don't care what the city is paying out as long as they can claim the high road.  

Message to taxpayers for 2018......"Don't ever turn your back on Jack" b/c he surely will stab us in it!
