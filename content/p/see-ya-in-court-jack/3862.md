 Jack and council that follow his lead are so bad for our City. Theyre not doing their own job much less adding mayor duties to their plate.  

No accountability. It is the worse council in Fairhope history. 

Now this. Jack shows his Ass and now the whole country will see it. He is a bully and the council sit back and condone it so they're all guilty too. 

Not to mention the City Atty sat there while all this went down - didn't speak up to protect the City. And his minion (our new city atty Marcus) did nothing either. They both care nothing about Fairhope. Just work for the council who appoints them. Why isn't this a conflict?

So now what? Taxpayers are going to have to pay for Jackass being a bully!  He needs to step down because he's a total disgrace.
