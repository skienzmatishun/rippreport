 I hope whatever the outcome, if there is a settlement and/or verdict they are public. I'm tired of backroom settlements where the public is unaware of how much these lawsuits and settlements cost and often the settlements are sealed so that the public can never become aware of the costs. When the government is found to be wrong, Politicians need to be held accountable.
