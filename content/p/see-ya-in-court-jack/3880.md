 Jack Fan 2020. You wouldn't know Jesus if he was sitting next to you. You yourself certainly have what the devil and God stands for. This Sunday I want you to go to church and beg for forgiveness and ask your own pastor what he or she thinks?  Take a few minutes and watch some of the city's council meetings. If you should think that Jack Burrell and the Council treats people with respect and dignity that people deserve. Then you need to do some soul searching. Even the high school kids who are required to watch some of the meetings for a class project are amazed to see what they watch and are even more amazed when they are told Jack Burrell is supposed to be doing and acting and being a example of what a (supposedly) leader should act. You just be another dumbass person who has not seen or has done any research. True Christians do not act this way, nor do they comment like yourself. Get closer to God. You need it. Pull the Christian Card and you'll lose everytime. Says a lot about you and your character.
