 Jack Burrell should be denied any monetary legal funds since he was so much negative bull crap against the Mayor getting legal monies. Let him and his cronies pay for this. News flash. Don't you dare think that we don't have proven laws broken by some of the local city councilmen. Just chopping one tree at a time. Focus is the number one thing right now. During the lawsuit it will be proven beyond any doubt. Just how corrupted Jack Burrell and some of the Councilmen are. All of them are guilty by association and allowing Jack Burrell to do and act as he has without any constraints forced on him by the city councilmen themselves. No balls guys. It will hurt you in the long run. The questions that are going to be allowed during this lawsuit is a whole new ballgame. When Jack Burrell lies about one of you Coincien. We will be there to inform through Ripp's attorney to the Judge and Jury what is right and what is wrong.
