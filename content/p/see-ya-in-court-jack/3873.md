 I agree with the Council that the City does not need a full time attorney.   Large companies do have in-house council, but their primary responsibility is coordinating with outside council to deal with individual issues. House council may have dozens of outside attorneys on retainer to handle dozens of legal issues.  
 I can't possibly believe that that Fairhope would save a dime with this and that it would be an irresponsible waste of tax dollars.

 That said, I don't believe that we should sign up again with the same law firm that we had before and that was not very effective for the city.  Burrell is an embarrassment; he may be a bigger moron than Roy Moore!

Also, if Burrell were booted, the rest of the Council would step up and become leaders......does he have incriminating photos of the rest of them?  This is the big puzzle to me; why would they follow such a donkey to the death?
