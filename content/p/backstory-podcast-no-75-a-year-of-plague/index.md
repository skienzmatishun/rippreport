After a Year of living with the Plague in our lives the Congress has passed and the President signed into law this week a “Coronavirus Relief Bill” that will expand government welfare programs (sans the need to be actively looking for a job) w/ "Shelbyian Pork" to boot.

The former Duke and Duchess of Sussex gave an interview this week to Oprah Winfrey, doing their part, driving yet another stake in the heart of the British Royal Family.

Lee County District Attorney (suspended) Brandon Hughes has been hit with more charges related to the use of his office for personal gain.

The House Seat for District 73 is up for grabs in a special election next month and the candidates have “graveyards” not skeletons.
