 Just how the sewer board and utilities board accept the extra load without saying to the city, "Enough! The waste treatment plant cannot take anymore!"
A worker for Fairhope Utilities told me that the Fairhope electric grid is so overloaded that he is afraid that the grid will collapse.  Yet the Council keeps allowing more and more houses to be placed on the grid. 
If the City Council had any real backbone they would say "NO more houses!"  But they are owned by the builders.
The only REAL MAN is our mayor.  She shows more testicular fortitude than the "Men" on the council who are supposed to be biologically equipped.
