 Jay seems like he is under Jack's thumb too. They are all pro-development and pro-for themselves. Jay is not the sharpest knife. He was dead wrong about the change in government legislation. His legal opinion was invalid and erroneous. He is not a lawyer I would hire. The way he flicks his wrist when he talks is condescending, at best, and it really makes one wonder...this council is a joke. They follow lockstep a MS joke.
