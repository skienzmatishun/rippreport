 Beck should not be an Attorney - heard too much shit about him.  The City Attorney is not the "City Attorney" - he is for Burrell &amp; all the corruption in Fairhope.  Dig a little deeper!!  He and Burrell meet behind closed doors &amp; get paid off for doing favors for certain citizens.  It is more than obvious of what gets approved &amp; how it gets approved to benefit certain citizens.  Watch also who is on certain committees &amp; also on Fairhope Single Tax - BIG BIG conflict of interest.  Again there is meetings behind closed doors.  WHO do they think they are fooling?  It WILL come out.  Again, the City Attorney is NOT for the City Of Fairhope.  I hope it is all fixing to blow up!!
