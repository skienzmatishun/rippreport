 I supported Jack twice however once elected he started drinking Cant's cool aid.Jack half burned his bridge with me over his unethical method to settle the Dyas lawsuit,and then lied to the public saying it was a purchase not a legal settlement.
He burned the second half of the bridge when he used his Airport Authority position to sway a bid that favored board members and the municipal judge, whose private jet he had been flying in FREE, and before the bid. Last but not least is his outright bulling, in public, of the Mayor. He has no respect for the position of Mayor or women.I will strongly support Jack's opposition. Let's not forget about his police record, he keep secret, and has yet to explain.
