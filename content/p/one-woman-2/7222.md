 Your first and second sentence are slander and I bet you will not identify yourself. Your allegations are false. She was NOT out drinking the next night, that is BS. As far as the other incidents, I did not report on them because I did not hear about them. I have been hearing about McSharry and his many convictions for years. The man has a serious problem and needs help, not a pass.
