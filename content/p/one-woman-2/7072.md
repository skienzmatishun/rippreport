 In the run-up to the last election, Jack Burrell railed against the Fly Creek Apartments, promising to stand up for Fairhope voters and NOT vote to approve apartments (btw, Robert Brown was in lockstep with him).  After Jack was re-elected (and Brown was elected), they both decided to vote in favor of the apartments b/c they love Corte.  Enough from both of them!  I am not one of those accusing Brown of kickbacks from the City but I believe that it's long past time for Burrell and his buddies to get off of the Council.
