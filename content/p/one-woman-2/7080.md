 Every time that I hear that Jack Burrell is going to run for AIA  “Anything in Alabama”  I laugh my butt off. To even think he would remotely think about this has everyone, even the buttholes,  laughing too!  Cannot wait to show you how we can get rid of someone by showing them they will not get the votes! I guess they have already counted up and considered themselves elected. Please encourage Jack Burrell to run for AIA....Anything of Alabama. We will all be laughing!!! Can’t get enough of it!!! Do it Jack and we will all show you a picture of what a dumbass you really are. By the way Jack, just look in a mirror, you already have the picture. LOL!!!  Heard you can’t go back to Mississippi either!!!
