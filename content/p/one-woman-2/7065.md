 Jack is a jackass and I don't know how he has hijacked the city of Fairhope, but he has.  The old people believe that he is a 'Christian' (whatever that means to them).  I stopped going to the City Council meetings because those that spoke up for Jack appeared to be suffering from dementia.  The younger people here are great but they are waiting for Jack to die.  The balance of the City Council are thought of as Jack's minions; is there no man on the CC that can be President?  Jay Robinson has done a great job and is not hated.  Boone &amp; Burrell need to get out from beneath Jack's thumb.
