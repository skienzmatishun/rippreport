 Tina, this is a LOCAL website.  There is no local news media anymore covering local news except for the Shoe Station Daily that was once known as the Mobile Press Register
Gulf News Media is just a joke.  Fairhope Times is good at covering  streets closing due to popes being laid under Church Street and stays out of REAL investigating news
This leaves Ripp to cover the politics of the local politicians.   Ripp does not cover Washington politics because that is what MSNBC and Fox News is for.  Watch whatever you want to get your echo chamber to reinforce your views. So that leaves Ripp to cover local.   Even if Ripp is a Democrat,  locally it does not matter
Tina, are you another Catalyst troll?   I will take your silence as confirmation 
BOOM!   You just got owned!   Now run to Boone and tell him you got tagged and have him send another troll to make a futile run against Ripp
