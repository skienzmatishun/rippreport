 I appreciate this web page. Few people realize how super corrupt this area is. It has been a plaything of the Alabama elites since Bear Bryant was Alabama Football Coach. He hunted in Magnolia Springs and enjoyed the area.  Once everybody got smart and moved down here it became popular. The elites never thought their playground would be a tax collector.  

The bad thing about Alabama is that it is the absolute worst when it comes to its natural environment.  There is no care for environmental pollution or neglect of duty.  Alabama is a polluted state because the politicians don't care.  They sold out to business long ago.

So let's talk turds.  I went to the Fairhope Pier yesterday.  Walked to the end.  Tested the water with a simple water quality tester that anyone can purchase on the Internet.

Fecal coli was off the chart.  The water is NOT fit to swim or fish.  I am not trying to scare anyone but the bay water is NASTY.

Forewarned is forearmed.  

POOP in the bay.
