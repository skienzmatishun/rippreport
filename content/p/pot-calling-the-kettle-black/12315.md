Stop fighting it and drink the koolaid. It will be bitter at first but the koolaid will go down smoothly.   Soon your views will change.  Yiu will see the politicians not as the crooks they are but as Christian conservatives
You will not see your taxes going up, more traffic jams, crowded schools, sewer overflows, and the overgrowth of this area.  But you will see our Christian officials praying in public meetings, going against liberals Don Quixote going against windmills as their straw men.  
You must first drink the koolaid.
