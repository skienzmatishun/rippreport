 I will not bow to Christian conservatives. I think the whole Christian thing in Baldwin County is fake.  That's right  fake. I see these people go to church and then go after their neighbor's wife. They are not true Christians in a Biblical sense.  They are Alabama Christians and these folk lost their way a long time ago.  They worship Nick Saban and name their dog after him.  It's a wacky state, 49th out of 50 states in every good category and first or second in everything bad. Do you really think Kay Ivey has any clue of what is  going on?  I mean the woman is kept. Alabama really has no hope but here we are. We moved here 17 years ago from Iowa.  The town  was started by Iowans.  Now it is overrun. The locals all say they are happy with the jobs and new construction. Hold my beer.
