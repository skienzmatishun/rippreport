 You are missing the point, Dave Berg.  You go to church, maybe lead a Bible study class, and be seen in church- preferably a big church that has lots of people and is in style.   The people see you as a Christian and a Conservative as well
Then, you get vetted by Catalyst (or whatever it calls itself these days) and sell out to Cox and the developers.  You get elected.
So what if you “sin” a little along the way?  That is what church is for.  Oversee a trust fund that finds your children’s college? No bid contracts to your buddies? Impose a moratorium after you have approved your friends’ subdivisions?  Keep a minority part of town from coming in the city limits to keep the value down and then you can buy it on the backend at a discount ?  ALL OF THIS IS NO PROBLEM when you are connected to Elliot Haygood, Stacy/ Catalyst/SCB.
Just look for the plastic pipe signs along the road.  You will see the membership list one name at a time 
This is what being a Christian Conservative is all about here in Alabama
