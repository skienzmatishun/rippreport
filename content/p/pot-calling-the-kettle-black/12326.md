 "Alabama is so backward ass"
"You just cannot beat this bunch"
"49th out of 50 states in every good category and first or second in everything bad. Do you really think Kay Ivey has any clue of what is going on? Alabama really has no hope but here we are. We moved here 17 years ago from Iowa."

I don't understand why you stay here. You have to be miserable.  From what you say, you can't do anything about it.  Why not move?
