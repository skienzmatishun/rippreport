 I so agree with you.  I know that Karin Wilson can be abrasive, but these read like bogus claims designed to fit Jack's promise to drive the Mayor crazy and make her quit.  There must be a lot more skeletons in the Kant/Boone/Burrell closet that we even imagined for them to stoop to these levels.  I hope that Fairhope's insurance company does a LOT of investigating before giving these frivolous lawsuits the time of day.  I bet that both of these suits are underwritten by the Goobers.
