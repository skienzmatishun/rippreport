 It okay for any veteran so say whatever it is they want to say! We have defended, we put our life on the line for the FIRST amendment, so if we have earned the right speak. 

YOU need to simply say thank you to all the veterans for their service because we have provided you with the right to speak your mind too. 

This weekend is about honoring all those that paid the ultimate sacrifice for this country. Those that have died for your right to be free - don't attack a veteran, attack the person. 

All we have ever done for this country is provide folk like you the freedom that you cherish and love, simply thank us. Nothing more, just a simple thanks is all we ever want, no sympathy, just a thanks! 

Please, do not attack any veteran for any word they choose to use, for we have earned the right to speak, just as we have provided you the right!
