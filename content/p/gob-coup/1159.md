 And you think that Kant as better than Karin Wilson??? Even if the City ends up paying the $100,000, (not that she is guilty because I DONT BELIEVE FOR A MINUTE THAT SHE ATTACKED ANYONE) it would be a hell of a lot cheaper than the MILLIONS that Kant cost the City in Lawsuits for the Triangle and Publix, and let's not even mention the Airpoet Authority deal that the City is paying almost $400,000 a month for all that property at the Airport that should BELONG to the City since the Airport defaulted on their mortgage several years ago!!! I'm CERTAIN ALL OF THAT ADDS UP TO A HELL OF A LOT MORE THAN A LOUSY $100,000! So you damn assholes that just don't like Karin Wilson just need to get your head out of your ASS! GROW THE HELL UP! You're the ones that have something to hide, not Karin! MUST BE A YUUUUUGE SECRET TO BE MAKING UP THESE KIND OF LIES! ????????????
