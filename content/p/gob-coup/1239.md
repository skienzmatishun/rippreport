 I agree......she appears to be very unqualified for this.  Additionally, if it is true that she has zero education past high school and if she did file for bankruptcy a short time ago, I would add that she may be a massive embarrassment to the city.  She posts on her Linked in profile that she has a title that does not even exist here.  Someone needs to put the brakes on her before she does something to put Fairhope on the hook for tax dollars.
