 The council has done nothing wrong. They did not assault an employee, the mayor lost her temper just like the congressman did in Montana. This is going to cost the city lots of money, money that could be used to help our schools, this will cost more than what it cost to put all the lights downtown. Think about this, yeah, Fairhope wanted to change, now we have it and it is not positive.
Had a friend from Birmingham call me, ask me what was going on in Fairhope. Lord!
This mayor is causing chaos in Fairhope, she is killing this town, firing long-term employees and replacing them with her buddies that are not qualified. 
She needs to take responsibility for her actions and issue an apology to the city employees, the citizens and most importantly, an apology to that poor lady she attacked! 
She does not represent the city well, Fairhope is now known for the mayor that assaulted an employee.
I would move but my family has been here long before that mayor's family moved to town. All these carpetbaggers need to move!
