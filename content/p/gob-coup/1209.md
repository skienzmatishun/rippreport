 You are right, the mayor can fire whoever she wants, so long as she does not discriminate, retaliate, imitate or abuse her power, then she can fire at will. Alabama is a right-to-work state, so long as you do not discriminate!

Remember at one of the first city council meetings when the mayor took office she stated she wanted to hire someone that knew human resources? 

That statement alone can be used as prima-facia evidence that she was planning to fire the HR director after the alleged event occurred before the mayor allegedly assaulted this lady.
