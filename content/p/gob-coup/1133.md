 After reading this article, and I am trying to be impartial here but I am not a fan of the mayor, I believe this did occur. I could see the mayor saying what was stated, and I could she the mayor shaking someone. I believe after this report was filed, wasn't that when the mayor went to the hospital? I pray for this city this is all false, but I truly would like to see the dates the mayor was in the hospital and compare the dates. Damn! 
Someone help me here, what was the timeline on all of this? And if the mayor is going to transparent, as she stated she want all allegations or lawsuits against to be public then this must become public. IS this why the mayor reached out to the council? Did she want peace because the council is going to see this? Someone needs to connect all the dots, follow the timeline.
