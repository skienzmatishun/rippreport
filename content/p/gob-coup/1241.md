 The current mayor is dealing with all sorts of issues the next mayor would have faced regardless of who it is/would have been. That is the by product of the mentality if 'll worry about it later. It doesn't affect me. If the latest employee to file suit was Mayor she would be dealing with the same things.  Nobody had done the current employees any favors and they are the ones suffering in all this.
