 AMEN...Doesn't the mayor have a bar in her bookstore? Did the mayor brag that she has the only bookstore where you can drink wine and peruse the various books? Doesn't that bookstore have a children's section? This is a great example to set for the youth of Fairhope.

YEAH...let's look at all of them, not some a few but all those that serve in political office. If you serve alcohol then you should be responsible when someone has been served too much alcohol, then leaves your establishment and drives! The only politician I know that owns a bar is the mayor of Fairhope! DUI's, driving in excess of the speed limit or assault, they all should be punished. 

But you need to name a city councilman in Fairhope that has been a police report issued about them for assault? Name one, not even Kant was that stupid to assault someone, he took money under the table, ole Kant was slick but he was not that stupid. I don't know of a city council member that has been charged with DUI, or see drinking?????

The only official at the Fairhope city hall that police report filled out on them is the sitting mayor, and you really do not know where the investigation is going, who knows, the mayor could be criminally charged with harassment/simple assault under the Alabama Code.

You use to see a lot of pictures of the mayor post on her Facebook, now deleted, alway seem to have a drink in her hand.

They all need to go!
