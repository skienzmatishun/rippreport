 Jack is not going anyplace.  Karin Wilson has allowed her credibility to be destroyed 100%.   Roughly half of Fairhope voters voted for her but she waited about 24 hours after her election to show her true colors.......hiring her unqualified buddies for ridiculous amounts of money and bestowing royalty status upon herself.  I wasted my vote.  She is or has been advised by a bunch of morons who want power, status, revenge and recognition.  So sad......she could have been a great leader for Fairhope but she has sunk to Jack's level.  He will probably win this game b/c she has proven to be as corrupt as Kant.  So sad for our wonderful city.  Who will take responsibility for sewer in the streets and bay while our Mayor and Council Members line their own pockets with our tax money?
