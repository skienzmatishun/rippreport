 Too many carpetbaggers in Fairhope, Prichard demographics were blue collar! Yes, Prichard was white but an uneducated white populous. Fairhope has a lot of carpetbaggers and education folks for Mobile, times have changed. Back in the 70's a high school education would get you somewhere in life, now, even as diluted as a college degree is, at least you are better educated than in the past.
