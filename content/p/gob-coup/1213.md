 The mayor is correct, she did not commit assault, she committed HARASSMENT! She stated that it will be proven she did not assault the lady, she is just like a damn politician, she is simply mixing her words as to imply she has done nothing wrong. That is it, I am through with all of this crap! Who the hell can you trust around here! Who is telling the truth?

Alabama Criminal Code, 13A-11-8
