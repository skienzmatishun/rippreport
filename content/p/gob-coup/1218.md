 I don't think ANYONE wants there to a lot of investigating. They are all politicians, and like all politicans, they sneak around and plot against each other. And you can't make the mayor crazy, she is crazy already! 

What I truly believe, the mayor has a lot to hide, as do the others! Further, the Goobers did not underwrite these suits, the attorney took the suit based on the plaintiff collecting monies. So these guys are going to sue like hell, they want their money too! 

This is all a bag of crap, the mayor's approach, her lack of interpersonal skills, the GOB's plots, throw them all in jail. Go back and charge all the previous city council, the old mayor(s), if they are dead, dig them up and charge them, this includes Ripp because started all this crap!
