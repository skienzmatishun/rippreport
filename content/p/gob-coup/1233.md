 I believe that 'right to work' has to do with the ability to work in a trade without joining that union.  It has nothing to do with being able to fire someone.
However, I agree that the Mayor can fire anyone that she can't work with.  Fairhope didn't promise Sullivan a job for life; change can be an excellent thing if the Mayor chose to hire someone who was qualified for the job. Sherry Sullivan should be able to find another job if she did a good job for Fairhope and was not fired for cause.  We just don't have that information yet.
