 The lady that is economic development director should bring businesses in the city. Has anyone heard of this occurring our side of some companies expanding that were already here? Has she been 5-6 months now?

If she is the economic development director she needs to get some economic develop going! 

Or, at the end of the current mayor term, this lady runs for mayor and wins, worst case she ends up with a $100,000 salary but auto and all the benefits. 

If she stays here in Fairhope for 4 years, that appears it would be the longest time she has stayed with any company she has worked for.
