 Tried to explain this earlier. I'm glad you feel that way. Up to a jury but the person says the mayor is guilty???  These are unfortunately the people we have to put up with everyday! Maybe it will swing the other way. I'm actually seeing it in Fairhope. People are educating themselves to be able to have to live with these people and gain control. I'm so proud of the citizens of Fairhope. They are working so hard together to take on all the dumbases!  Keep it up Fairhope!!
