 If you feared for your job would you have filed a complaint? Why does a woman wait years before they file complaints against men for sexual harassment? 

They do not want to be labeled! The still have to go to work, and after 4 years this mayor will be gone, as in LONG GONE and this poor lady will still be there. She does not want to be labeled and harassed by some of the new hires the mayor makes.

I agree with one poster on here, she needs to apology to the lady and takes full responsibility for her actions. AND disclose the cost to the city for her acts.

This so wrong, so wrong on so many levels and uncalled for. This has changed my opinion of the new mayor, she will not get my vote in the next election if she runs again.
