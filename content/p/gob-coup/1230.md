 All them have been Lying and certainly committing harassment!   Seen it at the meetings and I heard their proven lies before the election.   Nothing to argue here. Oh. And a couple of them you can throw in unethical charges. Don't worry. They might not get convicted of the first 2. But the unethical charges are coming. Simple. Their campaign lies are actually disturbing enough!!!!  No one can disagree with that fact since it has already been proven several times since the election while during the meetings.
