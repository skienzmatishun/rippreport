 And we are a laughing all the way to the bank! 

Carpetbaggers come down from the north, they pay $25,000 an acre for pasture or $550,000-1,000,000 for a condo or house that we paid maybe $500 an acre or $150,000 for the house or condo!

Come on down you carpetbaggers! We are moving out of the city limits but we get to use all the facilities that ya'll pay for! 

Whow...come on down! $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
