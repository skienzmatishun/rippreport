 What are you smoking. Before making any judgement regarding Jack Burrell (which I guess you think is not going anywhere even after accusing him of lining his own pockets in your own post), the Fairhope Council or the Mayor, find out the facts. They all have been accused of doing something wrong. I promise you that the City Council regards most of the citizens of Fairhope as being ignorant and nieve and that they will not come together. They are in for a rude awakening because the citizens have already started a long time ago.  They deserve bettter treatment and they will get it. Just a short time ago they lied and voted opposite of what they told all of us they would while standing right in front of our faces.  Campaign Lies!!! That is one fact that we don't have to wait on an answer for. No matter who you voted for!!!  It's already been proven during several of the city council meetings.  This of course was all just to get votes to be able to screw us and they did!  They are sooo good at it which is another fact. Educate others about the facts only when you know them. 
Relax and enjoy your summer.
