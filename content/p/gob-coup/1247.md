 So the mayor hired someone as the economic director that does not have a college education, did the job announcement require a 4-year degree? IT seems the new individuals she is trying to hire are all highly educated, the men all have master degrees and she hired her friend without a college degree and they are paid close to the same amount of money?

Talking about someone being sexist. I hope you are wrong that Botox has a college education, at some level. Maybe she has like 4 classes left, got married and had a family and never finished.

I know our mayor would not fire someone that had a degree and replace them with someone that is not educated just because she is a friend. No one is that stupid.
