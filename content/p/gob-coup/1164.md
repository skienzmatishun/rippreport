 What proof do you have that the allegations made about the mayor are true? In this country, the accused are innocent until proven guilty. Would you like to be presumed guilty of something just because someone said you did it? And what "buddies" has the mayor hired who are not qualified? What is it they are not qualified to do? Why do you assume people she has hired are buddies? Mayor Kant indeed did hire relatives and friends (how were they qualified by the way?), but Mayor Wilson is being crucified for hiring people she may have known prior to taking office. It's a small town and would be difficult to hire anyone you have not at least met. As for the cost to the city, where is the concern for the costs of the numerous unnecessary lawsuits filed against the city (and paid out) over the past decades? There are many allegations in your comment, but little to back them up.
