 I am not a Paul Ripp fan, nor a Mayor Wilson fan and I believe in the first amendment, but you need to stop this type of talk. You can bitch, you can call Ripp out, and you can speak your mind, but you need to stop this type of talk about veterans. 

At the end of the day, all we had was each other, it wasn't about the flag, mom, apple pie nor America it was about each other. WE were there for each other, we died for each other, we cried for each other, and we shared out dreams of what we wanted when we got back home, we shared our water, a C-Rat, our fears, our laughs but we all knew that we never aired our disagreements outside of the family. 

If you are a veteran, then stop attacking other veterans! You can attack the person but not as a veteran! You need to shut the fuck up with this talk, if you have been to war then you know we never talk about war or our experiences to others. Others would never understand what that experience is about. Those of us that have been to war know the unspoken rule, YOU need stop attacking this veteran. Stand down!


You are dismissed, son!
