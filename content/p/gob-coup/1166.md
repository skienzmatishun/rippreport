 No, two people said she did it, not one! This is not she said, she said issue, this is an issue that has a witness that saw the assault.

The reason Kant is no longer mayor is crap like this!!! We are concerned about the past, thus a change in leadership. We wanted transparency, we wanted the lawsuits to go away, but now, they are bbbaaaccckkkk!

Mayor Kant was never sued for assaulting an older lady! 

Look, everyone knows she hired her buddy, the lady was in DC, prior to that she lived in New Hampshire, and prior to that who the hell knows. Her mother worked at the bookstore, and her buddy worked for Dean prior.

Transparency...remember that word, remember her words about watching over our assets, spending our money correctly, ending lawsuits, employees are our biggest asset (unless you didn't support her) then you are fired.

Small town, lol, keep lying to yourself, keep trying to defend her because that what some do. YOU should demand she apology to the citizens over all of this, but instead of doing what is right YOU trying to defend her. 

Have you heard me defend Kant?
