 You fail to report that the campaign manager for new council member Conyers was no other than Scott Boone

You want to boycott a station, have it go out of business, and be a vacant building?

Let me get this straight too. Say I've been friends with Snedeker years before I became involved in politics, took a ride on his plane, split the cost of the trip(fuel, cost, etc...) and got no personal gain out of it. What's the big deal?
Tell us Ripp. When did the trip occur, what was the destination, who was on the plane, and how did it benefit either one of them?

You and JD Crowe seem to be awfully quiet these days?
I believe your queen is in real trouble and you are only seeing the top of the iceberg
