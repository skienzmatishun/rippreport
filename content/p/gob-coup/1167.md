 THAT IS WHY KANT IS NO LONGER MAYOR fool! Wilson was the lesser of the two evils, we knew what Kant did but Wilson was making promise, after promise, after promise to stop the lawsuits, remember the fresh eyes theory? 

She been in office how long? We have just begun to add, it took Kant what 16 years to cost the city all this money. So it would appear she is on track to cost us about the same, maybe a little more. lol  

Mayor Wilson's spending on salaries and other issues to come...$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$. 

The reason Kant is no longer mayor is the bad decisions, but looking back, he represented the city in appearance, speaking, and his demeanor was better, notwithstanding he made poor decisions so he needed to go!

If are using the Kant argument to defend her then you need to get a glass stomach because it is hard so see where you are going with your head up your butt! LMAO, Still LMAO.

Instead of "Karzy" Karin, the name should be "Spendthrift" Karin!

Or "One &amp; Done" Karin, Or "Lefty" Karin, Or "Tyson" Karin!

This is like trading one car that has 100,000 miles on it for another car that 120,000 miles and both cars are 2015 Kia's!
