 I agree 100% and I'd buy a ticket and pay top dollar to watch that show. Why has Jack Burrell not come clean. Jack has not denied a single thing. I agree that if all the things that the Ripp Report has said were not true about Jack Burrell, then why wouldn't Jack let us know that it's wrong, misinformed or even Fake news! I'd sue anyone saying all of this about me if it were not the truth. Jack can't or Kant!  Just one time I would like to see anyone of these councilmen come out THEMSELVES and say this is not true and prove it. Well, they haven't. They owe it to us and especially to themselves. I damn sure wouldn't put up with it. All the lies told by many of the sitting city council members just to get elected have already proven to be just that. Lies! If this isn't true? Stand up for yourselves if you truly think you are right and being wrongfully accused. Do it at the next meeting. It's that simple!
