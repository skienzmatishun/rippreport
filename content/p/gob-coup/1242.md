 Here's what I would really love to see, all of the council to resign. Not because they have done anything wrong but just to prove that if this mayor runs this city the way she wants, this city will be destroyed. 

I would not work, run for office or volunteer for anything to do with the city of Fairhope! Not anymore, not with this mayor!

Since the new de novae carpetbaggers have moved it, those that moved here to live because they loved it, and are the same carpetbaggers that want to change our city. Why did you move here to start with? We have two long-term mayors and they both made Fairhope what it is today. 

Not someone that moved her 10, 20, or even 30 years ago. It is funny when others build something how others want to jump in and start beating their chest and then try and run things.

GOB's, well, they built this city, they made this city attractive for others to want and come here. When you bring in others that have done nothing for the city, never volunteered for the city

The question that needs to be asked, why dod you move here? Did you leave your old city because you didn't add value to your city?
