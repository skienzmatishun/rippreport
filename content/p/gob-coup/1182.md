 It will be up to a jury if it goes to court! Think about that for a minute, a city government, a mayor firing a long-term employee. Ladies and Gentleman of the jury, this lady gave her life to the city of Fairhope, then mayor did her wrong...

If you think folks in this county thinks highly of Fairhope think again. Remember the mayor talk about folks outside the city limit not paying their fair share? "They don't add anything to the city." Well, I know how this is going to end, and it is not good for Fairhope or the mayor.

The discovery process, the interviews with witnesses, the emails, the phone logs, depositions, the depositions is where someone is empeached because that is what a deposition is all about. 

The easy money is on the plaintiff!
