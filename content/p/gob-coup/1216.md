 What does that even mean?  So Tim Kant's 90 year old father in law who was useless for the city but very well paid has been rehired?  By whom?  Please constrain comments to facts (or even possibilities).   I doubt that the city will re-hire a 90 year old man again, but if I am wrong please supply facts.
