 LOL, Fairhope was the gem of the Eastern Shore, not so much. Mayor Wilson is not only the blunt of jokes around Fairhope, but Mobile, Birmingham, and all of southern Baldwin County. You have not lived around these parts long, have you! 

The only money I would ever place on the mayor is to help whoever is running against her! I'd put money on Ripp before I would put money on Mayor Wilson!

Move back to Florida from where you came! Carpetbagger!
