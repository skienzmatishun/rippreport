 I think that her linked in profile read that she had taken a class at Harvard; it may have been a summer class or just a short seminar. I can't remember the details but it definitely did not state that she was a graduate or had even attended for a year, for that matter.  She should publicly release her resume so that Fairhope can see what we are paying for. She is full of buzz words but seems to lack any substantive experience or accomplishments.
