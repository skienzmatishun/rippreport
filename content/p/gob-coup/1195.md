 "Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury".  You said it will be up to a jury if it goes to court. Well, why don't we and especially you, all wait and see what happens first. I think we all agree with that part. Honestly, the Mayor really does and should have the right to fire any employee she wants to. That's the way it has worked for decades in Fairhope and in any other cities for that matter. Never a problem for Kant?? Interviews, emails, depos, etc. You are trying to be the witness, the judge and the jury which you are none of these. You had it right in your first sentence. It will be up to a jury (or even a judge) if it goes to court. Leave it at that. I'm sure the truth will come out no matter which side you are on. By the way.  People get fired everyday and in this case, the Mayor didn't have to give her a reason.
