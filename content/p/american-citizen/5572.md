 Speaking of DUI Chris Elliott. Baldwin County is in fact going out of his way to push and fool the Teachers of Baldwin County. Simply put:  Eddie Tyler doesn’t seem to care if Chris Elliott or our upcoming teenage drivers get drunk before they get behind the wheel. A vote for Chris Elliott is a vote for Eddie Tyler and all those who drink and drive. Teachers, don’t let Essie Tyler or Chris Elliott fool you. They both are the FOOLS and Eddie Tyler, see you and the next meeting. This goes for the school board as well.
