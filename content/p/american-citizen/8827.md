 What does Catalyst do?   They run campaigns of their puppet politicians 
Catalyst gets money from the real estate developers and have them funnel the money to the politicians in the form of campaign contributions
The politicians then pay Catalyst to run their campaigns. 
These facts can be seen by sec of state campaign reports
However you also have to check the timing of the payments.    The timing is used to throw off the casual observer 
Kind of like the Triangle Trade during colonial times
