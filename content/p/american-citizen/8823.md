 Mister Ripp,
When will catalyst build a web page?
Write a bi-weekly newsletter?
Maintain two Facebook pages and a weekly pod cast.
What exactly does catalyst do?
If the rumors are true that Kant is running for his old job
I would say Mr. Kant is wasting his time.
Fairhope ain't going backwards now. No fool is going
to vote for Kant in 2020. That would be like voting for Biden.
