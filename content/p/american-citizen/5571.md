 A little off subject. The Catalyst such as Michelle Thomason is a no brainer. Out with the Trash. Judge Thomason is definitely on the way out. On another subject, another Catalyst Chris Elliott is blowing smoke up the asses of of all our fine Baldwin County Teachers as well as out superintendent Eddie Tyler pushing for DUI Chris Elliott. BEWARE Eddie Tyler, we can have your ass fired easier than all this election bull crap. You keep pushing DUI Chris Elliott and you will find yourself in another County. This goes for those on the School Board who are pushing DUI Chris Elliott. Change is easier when you drag out all the skeletons of somebody who works for us and is not elected. One last time!!! If you Support DUI Chris Elliott. You will put your jobs in jeopardy. Just try it. I have worked with many, many Baldwin School Teachers and I don’t think they are stupid enough to bite this hook. DUI Chris Elliott, you are on your way out and Baldwin School Superintendent Eddie Tyler. You have soiled your career so much lately that I hope you are not as stupid as you are making yourself appear. The campaign certainly can add Eddie Tyler to list get rid of all of you should you keep up your self Serving ways. Don’t care what your contract says. Our kids deserve BETTER!!!!!
