A good example of Baldwin County incompetence, political interference, lack of ethics, CATALYST, corruption and judicial failure, is all exposed in one incident, the McSharry assault case.

{{< socialpreview url="https://rippreport.com/p/judicial-trick/" >}}

The McSharry case is a classic example of Baldwin County justice. Fairhope City prosecutor, Marcus McDowell dropped the ball, or kicked it out of site, when it came to Ronan McSharry. Municipal Judge Snedeker, shares in this miscarriage of justice.

How the hell can you read the facts, such as McSharry’s past convictions, pleading guilty, the incident on video, and accept Judge Stankowski’s ruling?

Stankowsli stated the charging document had a defect. The defect was that the first charging document did not have the wording,”Did cause physical injury to another”.

This document was not amended in the statute allotted time, one year, resulting in the defect.

How did this happen when the City attorney and Municipal Judge both had knowledge of medical evidence that supported the claim of “physical injury” ?

The City Attorney was personally given the medical evidence by an attorney representing Dinardi before her first court appearance.

McSharry has been free to continue his business while his attorneys try to blame everyone for McSharry’s actions. McSharry is not an American citizen, he is a green card holder from Ireland.

A Green Card holder with an extensive police record that has a liquor license. WTH

Here is a legal question, How much money has McSharry transferred from profits of McSharry’s to Ireland since the assault ?

## WHAT ABOUT THE VICTIM?

Paula Dinardi went to a restaurant/bar in Fairhope and gets assaulted by a drunk. This happened in November of 2018. An evening of relaxation turned into assault and physical injury. McSharry was arrested and Dinardi went to the hospital.

Just one month before Dinardi was managing the American Legion Tiki Bar on Mobile Bay. In October she had one event that drew 1000 people. Previously the bar was run with little organization and not family friendly. Dinardi had presented a business plan to the American Legion, which they accepted, and the business boomed.

In spite of the success of the Tiki Bar, the American Legion in January 2019, without any reasonable explanation, canceled their agreement with Dinardi. She had received nothing but compliments prior to the cancellation and assault incident. Dinardi was preparing for the 2019 season when the American Legion suddenly canceled their agreement.

The incident with McSharry started a spiraling sequence of events that has left Dinardi without a job. Many people believe politicians used their influence to remove Dinardi from the American Legion, me for one.

{{< socialpreview url="https://rippreport.com/p/you-dont-know-jack/" >}}

Next came 17 months of constant stress with having to deal with a corrupt judicial system, that favored the criminal, not the Victim. Dinardi is now trying to save her home.

The Fairhope Municipal Judge and City Attorneys actions has resulted in the GREEN CARD holder, McSharry, who plead guilty in court, to escape prosecution. The CATALYST City Council appointed both the City Attorney and Municipal Judge.

How can a GREEN CARD holder have such influence? Maybe his friend Council President Burrell?

The VICTIM, Paula DiNardi, is an AMERICAN CITIZEN and she does not export dollars to another country.

AMERICAN CITIZEN
