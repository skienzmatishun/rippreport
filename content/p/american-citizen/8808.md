 So what if McSharry is a foreigner and the lady is an American?   
Fact One:The fact is that McSharry is affiliated with Catalyst and the lady isn’t
Fact Two:  ALL PEOPLE ARE EQUAL - IT IS JUST THAT SOME ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS
Fact Three: Catalyst uses the fact that there is no more local news coverage except for Ripp and Langiappe to keep  people in Baldwin County’s ignorant of what is going on.  Any local coverage is about shootings and stupid puff pieces.   No more in-depth reporting because it costs too much so JOURNALISM IS DEAD

Keeping these three facts in mind will make your world make sense of the politics in Baldwin County
