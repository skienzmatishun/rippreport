 In one vote this fall fairhope can rid itself of the pentagon.

We need a ckean sweep. All five places replenished. Yhe time has come. Fairhope must change or be decimated like the jubilees that made it such a magical place.

The land deal for farm land for 2.6 million onky to rent it is a scam. A child could see this.

The soccer fields are not level. We cannot have tournaments in fairhope. I heard robert brown and kevin boone built the soccer fields and the concession stands.

Why is corruption tolerated in 2020 in Fairhope? Do anybody even care? This corona scarr should make everybody slow down and look good at fairhope. It's not a pretty thing to look at this point in time.

Quite frankly I embarrassed.
I am also worried abiut iur future. It's gonna get ugly if we don't change. We aint a littke po di k tiwn of 10000 no more.
