 The judge had to get McSharry off.  The political machine ordered him to do it.  
It HAD to be done according to the Good Ole Boy Network who makes up Catalyst.
So , what would you do if given an order?   You find any technicality that would allow you to obey the political machine and say it’s “legal.”
So, you find the timely amendment and viola!!    Job done, boxed check, and you stay in the Good Ole Boy Club.  
What’s so surprising about that?   
I use to live on Fairhope and I moved 6 years ago to get out of that town.   It looks clean on the outside but is filthy on the inside.   Catalyst is the rat that must be run out of Not just Fairhope but ALL of Baldwin
