The First Congressional District race is now down to two, Jerry Carl and Bill Hightower. Carl edged out Hightower overall by 1226 votes. Hightower the CATALYST candidate scored 3126 votes more than Carl in Baldwin County. CATALYST predicted 10,000 votes and fell short by more than 66%, this is a blow to their ego and evidence to their organization disintegrating.

CATALYST home is Fairhope and they claim all of Baldwin County as their turf. Times are changing and Baldwin County is waking up to CATALYST and their ambitions of total political power.

The common denominator of CATALYST is that all of their candidates, be they appointed or elected, use their position to further their personal gain.

The runoff is March 31, ask yourself, Does the First Congressional District of Alabama want a CATALYST Congressman? A CATALYST Congressman represents CATALYST, make no mistake about that.

The First Congressional District covers Baldwin, Mobile, Monroe, Escambia and part of Clark County. Baldwin County citizens are aware of CATALYST, we now need to inform our neighbors in the other counties, just what a threat CATALYST is.

This is a very serious race and the citizens of First Congressional District deserve a congressman that will represent his constituents and not special interest political groups.
