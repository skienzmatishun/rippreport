 If it was not for you Ripp, Catalyst would have OWNED this county and would have taken our state and federal representation.
Catalyst is going the way of a wrecked train.  with Stacey no longer running the show, it is up to Baby Boone to keep this train wreck going but Boone does not have the sense Stacey did.
I hope the politicians that are owned by Catalyst know that their kingmaker is in deep doo doo.
Burrell is next.  Then we can go to Daphne and clean up that mess.  Next the County Commission is next.  Then we can mop up the place and revisit Elliot.
Catalyst hijacked the Republican Party with their phony Christian Conservative hypocrisy.  Then they tried the old "Illuminati Conspiracy" story but facts are facts - Catalyst is funded by the developers and buy the politicians.
