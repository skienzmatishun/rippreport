The Ripp Report is pleased to announce our new Podcast Facebook page and our first Podcast. Future Podcasts will focus on political corruption in Baldwin County, which is a target rich environment. We encourage you to participate in our effort to expose the good ole boy system that has been entrenched in Baldwin County since the first pecan tree was planted.

The tables have turned on the status quo in Baldwin County, they have shrunk in numbers but still have a powerful hold on our judicial system. Of our 14 municipalities Fairhope City Council stands alone when it comes to a lack of leadership, transparency and accountability.

Exposure and the Court of Public Opinion will lead to the council’s removal in 2020. Monday night Fairhope City Council will vote themselves a free health insurance coverage. Additional they will set the Mayor’s salary, ignoring an Auburn Study, that was suppose to give guidance to these issues.

If you live in Fairhope please attend the City Council Meeting Sept. 9, see for yourself, what has become obvious to many, Fairhope Council is totally out of touch with their constituency.
