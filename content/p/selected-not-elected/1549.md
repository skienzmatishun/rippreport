 Tiny Timmy. If these things are all true then they should be questioned at the very next council meeting. I would have to agree with you that the quality of water in this area is bad enough without dumping additional harmful poo or other things in it. This is another fine example of not only the leadership of the council works. But some of the Boy Scout leaders and volunteers are allowing the paid staff of the Mobile area Boy Scout council has no leadership qualities that our Scouts should be learning. Think what kind of example  the Councilmen of Fairhope has always set for not only the Boy Scouts,
But the rest of the youth that are paying attention and will be leading this city one day. Trustworthy and being loyal are the two top things all Boy Scouts are taught first. There are grown men who slipped through the cracks and have become Eagle Scouts in the past. The problem is. They do everything opposite and teach the kids nothing. Thank God for the honest and hardworking true scoutmasters and volunteers who do ALL THE WORK and actually have to push back these awful people, most of us know who they are, while teaching our youth and leaders of the future what is right from wrong. You don't have to tell someone your an Eagle Scout. You show them that you are.
