 Anything that has to do with Jester Triple-Six or posting of Strike Fast! Strike Hard! Is about as far away as someone trying to work together to make this a better town. They bitch until they are out of breath and are certainly no patriots of Fairhope or this County that we live in. Go be a non Patriot somewhere else. It's been proven that they all have screwed up in some manner. Can't choose a side when we all have seen the broken promises and the actions at the council meetings.
