 A Catalyst eating its own?  Hmmm.....
Well, if this is the case then there are other missing pieces here.  What other deals is Elliott going to make if Burrell challenges his seat?  Also, if Burrell moves up, who will take Burrell's place?
Of course this notion of Burrell "challenging" Elliott may all be nothing.
The point is this:  CATALYST PLANS EVERY MOVE.  EVERY MOVE IS ACCOMPANIED BY OTHER MOVES.  WHILE THE PEOPLE OF BALDWIN COUNTY PLAY CHESS, CATALYST PLAYS CHESS.
Do not ever  EVER underestimate their ability to manipulate the politics here.  EVER!
