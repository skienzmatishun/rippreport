 We have received calls from employees that have stated that employees of the city went to the Mayor and explained that Jennifer and Sherry were providing the former Mayor with reports dealing with city business as well as documents. This HAS NOT been confirmed, however they would not be fired without an expatiation.
So Sherry and Jennifer can clear this up by explaining why they were fired, they have remained silent????
