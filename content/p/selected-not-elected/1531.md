 Mayor Wilson knows her days are numbered! The city attorney does not represent the mayor, he does not represent the city council, Tut Wynne represents the city of Fairhope! The mayor is completely clueless, she is simply ill-equipped for the mayor's job. The city attorney does and can do an independent investigation when there is a claim filed against the city because he represents THE CITY! Her claims of not spending taxpayers money on these issues are what she is not doing, she is spending time and money. She is desperate, and her own worst enemy! My word, she really thinks she is untouchable! Complete fool! 

Strike Fast! Strike Hard!
