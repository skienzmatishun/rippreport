 I saw the boy scouts are having a tri-athlon swimming event at the Fairhope Pier. Does any of these boys' mommas know about the poo problem in the mobile bay? Perhaps councilman Burrell, who signed the deal to throw ten million dollars at the current system that dumps poo in the bay every day can talk about this at the next fairhop sh*tty council mtg? Those poor boys should sue the cr*ppy council. Good ole boys gave you the poo! don't forget.
