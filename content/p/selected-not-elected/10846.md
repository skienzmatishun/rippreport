 CSB doesn't steal elections and they do not have to steal elections. They just get their folks out to the polls to vote.  The rest of the uninformed and apathetic citizens are too busy working and paying high mortgages to learn about what is going on in the town.
The Feds would not even think to prosecute a fair election.
