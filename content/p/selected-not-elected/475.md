 we all act like a bunch of little kids on the playground.  lets get our act together and if we have done something wrong stand up and admit it and if not stand your ground.  the new regime is entitled to put there people in the jobs she wants and nothing can be done about that.  for the  wonderful people that lost their jobs reminds me of a quote I remember from the book "university of hard knocks" that read "don't wait to be thanked hurry on to avoid the kick"  this is what the pair of wonderful women will have do and hold your heads high for the great job you have done for the city of fairhope and I pray to GOD that you will be rewarded in the future.
