 When you are being investigated, you do not have a right to be the investigator! The mayor is under an investigation, the mayor is the accused and a witness, she not entitled to see anything but the final report. If she did then she would change the outcome to favor herself, and retaliate! When it is an independent investigation, it must be independent! Mayor Wilson knows what she did was wrong, she knows the truth and her supports know the truth, but they are in denial! Tut is a man of integrity and will do what is in the best interest of Fairhope, not the mayor, not the council but what is in the best interest of the CITY!

Strike Fast! Strike Hard!
