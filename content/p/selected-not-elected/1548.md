 Leaders? The 2 Marble Mouthed Morons (B&amp;B) cannot even verbalize moderately complex thought. Jack cannot pronounce "Perpetuity" and Boone needed Beavis to clarify his own motion (go to 45:00 of the last Council meeting), as he could not do so on his own. It is embarrassing to say the least. GOB's that are relics from another age.
