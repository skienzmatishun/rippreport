 Anonymous says: "I know for a fact why and Karin had no reason. At least not a legitimate one."  It needs to be said - AGAIN - Mayor Wilson does not need a reason.  She and she alone is in charge of hiring and firing.  The fact that she didn't replace all the supervisors when she came into office is frankly more reasonable than what most new Mayors would have done. Why would anyone believe the statement "I know for a fact" by someone who won't give their name?  But even if it were true (which frankly, few people believe), that means nothing.
