 Concur totally! I've yet to hear anyone that is happy with her, and I have asked so many people that vote and have not hear one good word. Many of them voted for her, they have said they are so disappointed. IF she makes it to the end of her term and decides to run again, she will not get reelected to any office again. Period!

This mayor will only be transparent when it is convenient for her! She is saying she doesn't or will not approve any settlement, but she knows it is not her call, so it sounds great on her Facebook post. She is acting like she is standing her ground but she knows that a settlement is not her call! LOL

All you mayor supporters keep believing in her, she is not a truthful person! She is playing what few supporter she has left as FOOLS! Wakeup Fairhope and smell the coffee!

Strike Fast! Strike Hard!
