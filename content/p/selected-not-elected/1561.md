 Anonymous is calling Jester a coward again! LOL

Why would I need to write a letter to the council? They are doing a good job, and if I wrote a letter to the mayor she would not read it because she is not going to listen to anyone that has good since! I have no problem signing my name - Jester Triple-Six.

Strike Fast! Strike Hard!
