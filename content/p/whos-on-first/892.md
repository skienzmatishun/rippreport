 LMAO

Those who think the mayor will win re-election is blind. 

When you elect someone, that person speaks on your behalf, you voted them into office. Your vote was not attached with a caveat that states, before you vote you need to listen to me, then vote the way I want you to vote. That is not how this works, he speaks of his beliefs, then when he is elected, he votes what he thinks is best. 

Think about, if you are capable, how does an elected official please everyone that voted for him? He can't, so that is why can vote him out next election. You guys are so lost, you are blinded by the bliss!
