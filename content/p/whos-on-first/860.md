 If we can't count on council to be "responsible" then we hold them accountable. 
We can't sit back and allow this to continue because we have a long time until the next election! You must call, email and go to council meetings. No more special interests dammit! It needs to stop now!! 
Jack and Kevin are a lost cause and will be voted out next election unless forced to step down before this. 

Jimmy, Jay and Robert? You need to show us you're the change we voted you to be. Stop listening to the old regime.
