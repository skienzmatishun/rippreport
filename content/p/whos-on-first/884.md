 How did Kant rig the election?  I'm not saying that it would have been impossible but I don't understand how, with proctors at the election site, it could have been done.  The poll workers do a great job of checking voter ID cards against the registered voter rolls and we feed our ballots into an electronic counter.  I don't see how so many believe that there was anything that Kant could have done.  Would love for someone to explain.
