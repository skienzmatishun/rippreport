 I agree that Burrell &amp; Boone are more interested in promoting their own agendas than doing what is in Fairhope's best interests. However, Mayor Wilson has proven herself to be no better than they are. She is hiring her old friends at ridiculously inflated salaries rather than hiring people that would be best for the city.  I had such high hopes for her but she is just a female Tim Kant.  She will be voted out next time and we will have her to thank for 'Mayor Burrell'.  She has actually succeeded in making me feel sorry for the Council!  I hope that she ditches her 'advisors' and gets rid of the friends that she has hired and actually begins working on the agenda that the promised voters before it is too late.  Tuesday night when she presents her 'State of the City', she should announce that she has let these friends go and she is prepared to act with integrity and class.  That is the only way to salvage anything left of her 'reign'.
