 Kant had at least 6 to 8 relatives and about a dozen friends all drawing a pay check. Mayor Wilson has no relatives and hired one person she knew who was qualified. In fact Sherry Lea's resume speaks for itself. Her department cuts by Council in particular Mr. Burrell was in retaliation for the Mayor firing two employees and Mr, Burrell's opposition to anything the Mayor has proposed. Fairhope  desperately needs what was proposed, the council had no plan and no suggestions, just same ole same ole. Fairhope is who is going to suffer.
