 Sherry Lea is not qualified for this position, short term positions on her resume do not constitute qualifications.  Anyone can have short-term successes, anyone, working for the mayor's biggest ally does not qualify a person! 

The mayor did not post the position, she wanted to hire Sherry Lea before the position was created. The mayor does not own the city, this is not her company. 

All of you know better than this, measuring your ethics to Kant is not a high bar. 

In the end, the mayor will throw all under the bus to save her position or her standing within the community. That is how politicians operate, everyone needs to copy this post and refer back to it in about 3 years when she wants another term.

Politicians are politicians, they will tell you what you want to hear, then do what is the best for them, that is what they are called politicians. What is needed is a leader, a statesman, someone that will make hard decisions and stand by them. Someone that is smart enough to surround themselves with independent thinkers, not friends. 

Look at what happens when politicians hire friends, look no further than Clinton and Trump. The day the mayor changed her opposition from the owner of her bookstore to a politician I knew her head was in the wrong place. One-term and done!

I loved what Council Brown stated 'if you don't like the way I vote then vote me out in the next election.'
