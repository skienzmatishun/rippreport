 Welcome to Trump's world - she will be fighting these allegations every day. Folks that have never been sued before really won't understand, all the discovery, oh the discovery process. 

All communications, different witnesses, the depositions, he said, she said. The complaint, the written complaint filed in court is a declaration of war, then there are the allegations. The mayor will be called every name, it will all be public record, then, then there are the coffee clubs - yeah - those gossip clubs.

This is why you really don't ever want to be a CEO because when the light shines, it shines brightly during the good and bad times. 

Being sued is no fun, it will affect you, your family, your business. It is the worst stress of all stresses. 

I don't support the mayor's handling of many situations but I really feel for her in this situation, this is no fun.
