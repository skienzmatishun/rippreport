 The only way ( self awarding BP contracts and Autism rights hater) Trip Pittman will sneak into the U.S. Senate is if someone let's him in to use the bathroom!  This also goes for  Mr. DUI and professional Liar, Baldwin County  Commissioner Chris Elliott getting into the Alabama Senate.  The only thing they both might sneak in is 15% of the votes when they run and that's pushing it. What part of this isn't true?
