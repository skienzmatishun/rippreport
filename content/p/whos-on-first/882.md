 We, the voters, are responsible. We have voted for the government that we deserve!   We have, once again, voted for 'special interests'.  Maybe there are no honest choices and we vote for the lowest common denominator of corruption (Mayor Wilson) but now she has proven her own corruption so swiftly and smoothly. 
I hope that she will fix her 'little red wagon' on Tuesday night by admitting her mistakes, letting go of Botop and the Rock Creek lady, and working with the Council (no clean hands there, either, other than Conyers, but at least an effort to work FOR our community).  Otherwise, she is surely toast as is our beautiful city. 
Fairhope will survive, perhaps better, if any of the 'players' decide to resign if they can't work together.  Wilson won by a very narrow margin ( I voted for her, as did most of my friends......most wish that they could reclaim those votes and give them to someone else!) I still hope that she will wise up and work for the city that she claims to care about.
