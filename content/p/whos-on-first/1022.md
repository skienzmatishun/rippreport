 You call that a career!  What career?  We fishermen know what he did by criminally polluting our waters even more by leaving the anchors in the bay. Simply give us a notorized statement saying it didn't happen. HE CANNOT AND WILL NOT. As boat captains and part of the BP clean up crew. We know for a fact he broke several  laws and unethically took, awarded himself as he likes to put it, money from the BP and State clean up fund to the tune of serveral 100 thousands of dollars. Just compare his banking account for 2009, 2010 and the next couple of years. All he has to do to clear all this up is share with us that he didn't have any contracts of well over  a half million dollars. HE CANNOT AND WILL NOT! Certainly not a conversationist or cares about the environment. Not in south Alabama! Not anywhere in the World!!! Possible candidate??? Joke of the Year!
