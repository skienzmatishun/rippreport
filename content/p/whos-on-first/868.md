 I read that there was a woman from Rock Creek who is a good friend of the Mayor's who was hired at an exorbitant  salary for a part time assistant position; then when the Council nixed that position that she was moved to golf course management, despite having no experience.
I don't see anything in Botop's resume that would suggest that she is the best candidate for Fairhope's needs.   I don't know what the Mayor is thinking, but she needs to understand that the optics of her actions have convinced most of Fairhope that she is either not very bright or that she is as equally corrupt as Kant.    She can only salvage her reputation by firing her friends and then starting over and doing what she actually campaigned to do.  She has only deepened the swamp so far.
