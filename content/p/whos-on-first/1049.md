 How many times have you been sued? Have you every been sued personally? If you have then you will know just how hard can be, because you never know what a judge, a jury or what an insurance company will do. It is the unknown that is what is so stressful, you never know what is going to be said, what will be discovered. 

Think about this, what happens if this lawsuit is denied by the insurance carrier to defend. Then it turns to your personal resources, and it can cost thousands upon thousands of dollars. If you settle, then where does the money come from if the insurance carrier denies coverage. 

If you think lawsuits are not stressful then you are clearly a damn fool.
