 Nobody in this town still wants to admit the corruption. Kant rigged the election for years. You know it. I know it. The fence post knows it. Stop acting like Fairhope is a utopia.  It is not. We have major growing problems because we took the impact fees an spent them on lawsuits. We have no infrastructure but the gravy train rolls on...at Fairhope's peril.
