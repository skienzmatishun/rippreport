summary: I have followed Fairhope politics for over 23 years and if there is an example of the Good Ole Boy Club, Fairhope wins, hands down. The key player in the club is councilman Jack Burrell. Who has become the most infamous flip flopping, double talking, lying politician in Baldwin County. His time in office has racked so many questionable actions, side deals, conflicts of interests, quid quo pro deals and bids that it would take a book to list them all.

I have followed Fairhope politics for over 23 years and if there is an example of the Good Ole Boy Club, Fairhope wins, hands down. The key player in the club is councilman <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Arippreport.com+jack+burrell">Jack Burrell</a>. Who has become the most infamous flip flopping, double talking, lying politician in Baldwin County. His time in office has racked so many questionable actions, side deals, conflicts of interests, quid quo pro deals and bids that it would take a book to list them all. But here is a few:

You can go to The Ripp Report.com and use the Search bar for Jack Burrell and go back years and read about one incident after another where Mr. Burrell was the key player.

{{< socialpreview url="https://rippreport.com/p/two-questions-decide-fairhopes-future/" >}}

1. Jack has been the key council opponent for establishing Districts. Districts are key to transparency. The current council just ghosts citizens complaints and the citizens are left with no resolution to ANY issue. Case in point the Library issue.
Districts provide the community a representative on the council, who is accountable to his district.

2. Jack orchestrated the Mayor to be the head of utilities and receive a second paycheck, aka double dipping. This was a reward for winning the covid election in 2020. Under Jack’s guidance the council
Fired the qualified utility engineer and replaced his qualified position to a high school graduate with no qualifications for such a position. The prior Mayor Wilson had placed a qualified engineer in charge of utilities. She also refused any second check from the city, stating it was highly unethical. Jack Burrell the council and the Mayor are supposed to hire QUALIFIED employees.

3. The waterfront project was in the 11th hour of the Wilson Administration. She secured the funds and had many community meetings and surveys that contributed many good ideas. That was 5, you hear me 5 years ago. The original contractor was replaced and the projected cost ballooned from 6.3 million to 10 million. The council and Jack say the increase was due to the rise in construction costs, B.S. Jack threw the original community approved project in the trash can. The result is a project that is still not finished. What has been finished does not look like 10 MILLION dollars. In fact it raises many questions and the project should have a forensic audit.

4. Mayor Wilson left millions in grants dedicated to infrastructure. Jack and this council have yet to finish the infrastructure upgrades, in 5 years. Jack did not want to spend money on another water tank. That has resulted in multiple water shortages all the while approving new development..

5. Jack and the council are supported by developers, engineer companies and special interests.
Mr. Burrell just accepted 500 dollars from Jade Consulting, who has a pending project for development. This is nothing new they have no SHAME.

6. Freedom of Speech Jack refused ,yours truly, the right to speak in front of the city council during a scheduled public participation. Jack had to eat crow and the federal mediation resulted in Jack and the council losing and having to pay my attorney fees. As well as the city attorney fees. This was in Federal Court.

7. Publix on Parker road. Do ya remember all the violations the council ignored. The project dumped tons of mud in Fly Creek and bulldozed the county and city right of ways. The developer was a major contributor and good ole boy of the Mayor. Jack did their bidding and in the end there were 5 lawsuits and major environmental damage. Citizens were ignored and the council and Mayor did what they pleased. Thanks Jack???

8. Jack is the major force that reinstates the same municipal judge and municipal attorney. The council just rubber stamps Jack’s selection. A new council or getting rid of Jack would open up the opportunity for a change in city attorney and municipal judge.

9. Jack and the council did not object when councilmen were using their position to secure bids from the city or bids they secured by being on the board of a city funded entity. Case in point is former councilman Brown and his contract with the Fairhope Art Center. Former Councilman Boone also ate from the same apple. They both are gone but no one on the council took a position on ethics or conflict of interest charges.

10. One of Jack's close friends is Ronan McSherry. McSherry has been arrested multiple times for multiple reasons. Most often for assaulting women. Jack and the council remained silent while the municipal attorney did everything he could to cover-up any wrong doing. They both failed the citizens of the community and the multiple victims.

Fauxhope keep Jack-- Fairhope-- vote Jack OUT make a needed change vote for Troy Vickers place 1
