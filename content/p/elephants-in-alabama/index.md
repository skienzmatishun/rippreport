If a herd of elephants were to roam loose in Alabama, most news sources could not find them. Probably the biggest story, political story, is the evidence emerging about the Bar Association and the Ethics Executive Director. Only Lagniappe has had the balls to print the facts.

The Attorney General has only covered the backs of the Bar and Ethics, no criminal charges have been filed.

Now a civil lawsuit has been filed, outlining the charges against the Ethics Director. Will this finally wake up the press ? Maybe, however The Ripp Report is going to disseminate the articles and facts for you. If this is not clear evidence of how corrupt Alabama is, what is? No state agency, or our Governor have taken any action. Alabama will remain the most corrupt state and laughing stock of the United States, if such blatant corruption is ignored.

Please read this recently filed lawsuit involving the Executive Director of the Ethics Commission, Tom Albritton, he should be removed from office immediately.

The Ethics Commission didn’t offer a single detail about what laws he’d been found guilty of breaking or how they were broken. Using state payroll data, it’s clear the person known simply as “Employee 1” in the Examiners’ report is McCallum, and he was paid his salary for a couple of months after resigning. He also continued receiving perks for an even longer time. For some reason, about 10 months after his resignation, the State Bar paid him another $37,000.

“The Ethics Commission’s Executive Director, Tom Albritton, has got a pass from the Ethics Commission, Alabama Bar and the Attorney General. The only recourse for any justice is to file a civil suit against Mr Albrittion the trustees and the bank. This is blatant in your face corruption, at the highest level of our state’s government.”

Please, as citizens of Alabama write a letter or e-mail to the Governor. Talk to any of your local politicians and ask them to explain the lack of transparency, accountability or ethics.
