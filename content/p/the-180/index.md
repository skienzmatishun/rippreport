Yes VP Harris has gone from the scourge of the democratic party to their darling savior. They were riding high from the Democratic National Convention and then RFK Jr removes his name from battleground ballots and throws in with Candidate Trump consuming all of the oxygen in the room.

And, headline: Finebaum claims the University of Alabama Football Dynasty over.
