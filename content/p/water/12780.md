 We need to blame ourselves for allowing ourselves to be duped by outsiders who blew in, called themselves Christian. conservative, and said things like hometown while actually being real estate folks who just wanted to overdevelop the place.    We now have more taxes, traffic, crowded schools, and crime.   This council has stolen our town from us.  
We must vote them out.  Send Jack back to Mississippi, Jimmy back to Atlanta, and Brown back to wherever he is from because he is NOT from here either 
This bunch  has allowed so much growth that we are running out of water because they are selling it to outside developers 
If they invoke their water emergency and try to fine those using water, can you imagine the PR meltdown because of the fact that they sold OUR water to their developer friends?
