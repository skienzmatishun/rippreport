 Just look up the Secretary of State campaign reports.  Under each candidate's payments, you will see who they pay.  If you see Catalyst, LLC., then that means they are a Catalyst.
  You will see that Ball and Davis, county commissioners, are Catalysts. Politicians and judges here in Baldwin County are Catalysts.
   Now go see who contributes to each candidate.  You will see names such as DR Horton, Prebble, Real Estate PACS, Columbia Southern, and Volkert,  See? It is a money trail.  THIS ALL PUBLIC INFORMATION THAT THEY ARE HOPING THAT NOBODY SEES OR CARES ABOUT.

Now that people are figuring out who Catalyst is, do not be surprised if Stacey and Boone change their name to some other outfit.  They probably will because the candidates are getting defensive on using this group.  Watch the money take a different path....
