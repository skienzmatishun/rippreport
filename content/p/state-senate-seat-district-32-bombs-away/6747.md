 The event was wonderful! I was very impressed with every department. It was so nice to see the entire city council, the council president, the mayor, the city police, the departments heads and staff uniting for a community event and dinner. It was a positive experience. 
Thank you to everyone!
Thank you Ripp for a great report!
