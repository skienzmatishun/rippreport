Alabama has now reached a new low. From the most political corrupt state to a state that is considering

Electing a pedophile to the United States Senate. Our national reputation will be forever scarred by a man who champion’s constitutional rights, however he himself was found guilty for NOT upholding the Constitution. Being thrown off the Supreme Court twice did not bother some in Alabama.

How many people have you meet banned from a mall? It does not bother some in Alabama!

It is not accusations or allegations it is common knowledge among Judge Moore’s own community, Gadsden Alabama, that Roy Moore had a reputation for chasing teenage girls. But hell we can overlook that in Alabama. As long as Moore holds that Bible high he can count on a dedicated bunch of followers, all Christians, that will just look the other way.

Moore followers claim the Washington papers are on a witch hunt, however they have again turned a blind eye to all the newspaper articles coming from Alabama. From Fox news to al.com, supporters of Moore just ignore any press they do not approve of.

"You cannot vote for somebody that's calling people's mothers to get permission when you're 30 years old to date a teenager."

Their are republicans that are sickened that their political party is associated in any way with Roy Moore.

However the republican “leaders” of the state have decided that it is more important to hold on to power and throw morals and ethics out the door.

In the coming weeks Roy Moore will drag Alabama and it’s citizens through the mud and if he gets to Washington they will bury him in the swamp. Alabama had better rally to do everything possible to prevent Roy Moore from ever becoming a US Senator.
