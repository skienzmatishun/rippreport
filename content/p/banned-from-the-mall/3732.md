 I could not agree more with this article; however, I am afraid that the under-educated and cult-ripe residents of rural Alabama are going to turn out in droves to elect this freak.  I voted for him in the Primary because Luther Strange threw Alabama beneath the bus when he worked his deal with Luv Guv Bentley; I (and many others) believed that Jones would lose to Strange but that he would surely defeat the freak show Roy Moore.  Any law-abiding Democrat beats a freak show like Roy Moore by a mile!

 Now, Moore &amp; his wife have turned to the national community of religious extremists to portray themselves as victims of a witch hunt.......clearly, this is all cash motivated (b/c the Moore's love their cash), but, sadly, Alabama voters are this stupid????  Please say NO MOORE!
