 Yep you are right.   Fairhope is being fun by a Mississippi State grad.  Meanwhile Daphne along with Baldwin County Commission has been taken over by a trio of developers who got started in Georgia, got run out of Florida, and landed here.   This place was ripe with low hanging fruit.  Build more and more subdivisions then sell commercial real estate.   They will cash out when they make their money leaving us left to pay more taxes to build up the infrastructure needed to support the population.   This is not growth, it is CANCER.   But we have only ourselves to blame for letting this happen.
