Meemaw AKA Alabama Governor Kay Ivey has a new alcoholic beverage sporting her likeness and name- complete with the Col. Sanders bow tie. That would all be fine and well if she was not an octogenarian running a complex organization that is pretty much off the rails. From private dollars to lawyers to defend the indefensible, to a Medical Cannabis License scandal designed to derail the entire program, and with a Legislature that is content with a special master drawing our congressional lines, to quote Mr. Ripp: "This place is nuts".
