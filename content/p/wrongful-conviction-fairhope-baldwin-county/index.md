Many people have seen the movie <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YzyVklCoAU">Just Mercy</a>, a true story of the wrongful conviction of Walter McMillan, Baldwin County, Alabama. A second case that parallels the Just Mercy story is that of Murray Lawrence Jr, Fairhope, Alabama, Baldwin County. This case involves the Judge, Prosecutor and Sheriff, lead investigator at the time of withholding evidence from the defense, an inefficient police investigation. Please take a few minutes and review the links below, they will inform you of the facts of the
wrongful conviction.


The Ripp Report is a not for profit organization and the attorneys Maxwell/Tillman are providing legal representation pro bono. The efforts to free Mr. Lawrence or at least get him a fair trial have been supported by many advocates, in the last 5 years. Thank You
