Novelis is Building a New, Low-Carbon, $2.5 Billion Aluminum Plant Recycling & Rolling facility in Bay Minette, Alabama, is the first of its kind and first fully integrated, U.S. mill built in 40 year and they are building it on the Baldwin County Megasite!

From the inception of the Alliance by the Chambers of Commerce at the behest of Baldwin County United, this has been a multi-year-village-wide-effort. From Lance LaCour, former BCEDA Director now in Katy TX (the Godfather of the Project) to Mr. Ingram, and all of the people who believed that this project would change our fortunes- much like the location of "Delta Rockets" on Decatur Alabama's Megasite some 15 years ago.

It seems that someone leaked a document purported to be a draft of a majority opinion of the US Supreme Court that would overturn Roe v. Wade. And the fallout has been and will continue to be catastrophic to moderates on both sides of the issue.; at least half of the population seems concerned. Most attorneys are concerned the the Court can not function without the ability to have confidentiality amongst the Justices.

The Morgan County Republican Executive Committee sent a questionnaire to the Alabama Attorney General candidates and we discuss Mr. Still's responses.

There are 31 illegal casinos operating in Alabama at this moment. There was another mass shooting today in Buffalo, New York that was streamed live by a white nationalist who also posted a manifesto (not that anyone should subject themselves to the ramblings of a terrorist). Governor Ivey has a secret Santa who just ponied up $1.7M so she can continue to run nonsense ads that do not address any issues. Mike Durant has lost his surge and Katy Britt is once again the "Bell of the Ball".

The Mobile Maritime Museum will be home to a bitcoin mine, no joke, located in a shipping container, stop snickering, at least they can help pay back the $60M that monstrosity costs. The Lagniappe Mobile Newspaper this week detailed reports of the Clotilda, impediments to green energy, and a Public Hearing May 19th related to the expansion of Baldwin County Sewer Service Fort Morgan Plant. And the people of District 15 who shouted down the Bertolla rezoning last week should plan to attend the Baldwin County Commission Meeting this week to ensure the decision is not overridden, as they are prone to do. And lastly, for your viewing pleasure, the Baldwin County Commission Meeting wherein they repealed the Comprehensive Plan.

A history lesson.
