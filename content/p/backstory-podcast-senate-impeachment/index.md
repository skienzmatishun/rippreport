107,883,016 SARS-COV-2 cases confirmed worldwide with a total of 2,370,735 deaths; with 27,393,896 in the USA with 475,459 deaths; 477,570 cases in Alabama with 9,021 deaths; 1 M vaccine doses delivered, 550,000 administered.

The Senate concluded arguments in the Impeachment of Former-President Donald John Trump today, for the second time. Brandenburg vs Ohio was the case on point and was mostly ignored- defining a 3 prong test for when speech is not protected. Spoiler Alert: The protagonist is a Klansman.

In short, The Senate should have called witnesses. The Lagniappe Mobile Newspaper takes aim at a number of issues- vaccine eligibility changes, The Mobile River Bridge and Bayway Project is back and Fairhope Councilman and Eastern Shore MPO Chairman Jack Burrell “the Great Negotiator” is right out front, controversy surrounding a firing range near Foley, Alabama, and and article about Who will run now that Senator Richard Shelby is retiring?

And who will bring home the bacon?

Tubbs? Bay Minette lands $200K for AR-15’s, an IR Drone, a Humvee, and Covert Surveillance Equipment (not a dime for taser shotguns). The Alabama Legislature is back in session without an audience so we tell you about the Bad Bills to watch.

Growth is always a difficult subject but the Golden Triangle project in Baldwin County near Stapleton, actually mostly in Spanish Fort Planning Jurisdiction, is a huge project (4,200 Acres with 12,000 residences and 1.5 Million Sq Ft of commercial space; and we discuss the reason the land was undeveloped until now.

AG Steve Marshall announced a $60M settlement with Terminix. Not one person is going to jail for violation of the Alabama Deceptive Trade Practices Act.

And Larry Flynt, arch nemesis of The Reverend Jerry Falwell, died yesterday.

He was an unlikely Free Speech Icon and the world is a poorer place because of his passing. And for good measure we throw in some Baldwin County History that may blow your little minds.
