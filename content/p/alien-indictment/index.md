This week we saw revelations come to light that indicate that the Executive Branch (Defense Department) has been concealing from Congress and the American People the existence of non-human remains and technology in the form of aerial vehicles recovered over the last 50 years. Almost as alien was the indictment of a former President for mishandling of classified documents, a crime which former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was given a "pass" by FBI Director Comey prior to the 2016 election. The Supreme Court of the United States again step-childs Alabama in a decision related to how our U.S. House Districts are not complaint with the Voting Rights Act of 1965, a huge gamble and loss for Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall.
