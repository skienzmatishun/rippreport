For the Record: 1. Harry Still is a Republican 2. Francis Paul Ripp is an Independent 3. Raines Rushin is a Democrat. The purpose of Backstory Podcast was to create a space for honest debate with a range of opinions and learned debate. And to highlight the level of public corruption in Alabama that Mr. Ripp runs across in his Not For Profit Consumer Protection Agency and Mr. Still observes in his Law Practice.

Mr. Rushin was an AP award-winning reporter in Gulf Coastal Mississippi, pre-Katrina. We hope that is why you watch and why you keep coming back. We are in the middle of a primary election and Harry Still is running for Attorney General of the State of Alabama against a man who was a Don Siegleman appointed Democrat until 2011 and now he is the Trumpiest Trumper who ever Trumped, a political chameleon. And you will hear about Attorney General Steve Marshall, "The Loop-holer in Chief" who took $725,000.00 (according to the Ethics Complaint filed by his opponent Troy King) last election cycle from an out of State Political Action Committee (Dark Money). Punchline: The Alabama Ethics Commission gave him a pass in a 3-2 vote saying there was insufficient evidence. And of course The Attorney General represented The Ethics Commission when Mr. Ripp sued them to compel them preform their legal obligations under the Constitution. The case was dismissed last week, their primary argument was that to maintain such an action, Mr. Ripp should have sued on behalf of the State of Alabama. In this episode we also talk about violent crime in Alabama, the Legislative Session, Constitutional Carry, the FBI raid on Prichard Water Board, The War in Ukraine, $7 gas, and our hopes for a "Palace Coup" at the Kremlin.... or one bodyguard with a Kalashnikov. The Republican Primary is May 24th.
