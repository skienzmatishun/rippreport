Last night Spanish Fort played Fairhope in football. The stands were full, social distancing was all but impossible.

When one of the High School Principals was asked why most of those in attendance did not have masks? He explained that they tried to enforce the use of a mask, however once the people got seated they removed their masks.

Another event across town was underway, the Fairhope political forum hosted by the Common Sense Campaign. The forum had been scheduled well in advance, by the Common Sense Campaign, and was provided to the citizens to better informed them about Fairhope candidates for Mayor and City Council.

All the City Council members running for office as well as the candidates opposing them were in attendance.

The Mayor and two of her three challengers showed up.

Sherry Sullivan was the only person not to show up.

This was very disrespectful to the other attendees and especially the host, Common Sense Campaign. To add insult to injury Sherry and her followers are suggesting that Mayor Wilson did the scheduling.

That is absolutely false, the Mayor showed up, by invitation, just like everyone else. Sullivan just made a bad situation worse by not taking responsibility for her actions.

Does this sound like Mayor material? I think not. Not only did Sherry not show at the scheduled forum, she showed up at the football game and gave fans to attendees NOT wearing masks. So the stands are full of people not practicing social distancing and not wearing masks.

What would be the worst thing possible in that situation?

Giving them a damn fan.

Give me a break if I read this not knowing anyone I would cross Sherry off the list, first.

Let’s not forget Burrell, Brown and Sherry wanted to “take a chance” with the Arts and Craft Show. Over 200,000 people attend that show. Doctors from Thomas advised against it, but Sherry Brown and Burrell wanted to push forward. This is another example of poor judgment on Sherry’s part as well as Burrell and Boone.

Truth is Sullivan does not want to answer questions or have any “high anxiety”, public forum.

{{< socialpreview url="https://rippreport.com/p/questions-for-fairhope/" >}}

Mayor Wilson adamantly opposed “taking a chance” and the Arts and Crafts show was finally canceled. That is what I call a Mayor, putting the safety of the citizens before profits.

Fairhope needs a Mayor who practices what she preaches instead of “taking a chance”, with other people’s lives. Sullivan has displayed a consistent pattern of bad decisions that shows very poor judgment, on her part.

The below was a post recently sent to the Mayor Wilson:

> “Karin, one of the difficult decisions you made was about arts and crafts not taking place. I know that was an agonizing decision for you!!! As someone that has been working in ICU during this pandemic, I so commend you for making that decision!!! The right decision!!! Sherry Sullivan was on the news promoting arts and crafts and promising “all precautions would be taken”! What a joke!!! My blood is still boiling from listening to her because she obviously was only trying to promote the event!!! This would have been at the expense of the citizens lives!!! Baldwin Counties cases of Covid during that time were probably less than 10% of Mobiles!!! This is a perfect example of you making the right decision for your community!!! Just know”. that you probably kept a lot of people from getting sick and many from dying!!! Trust me when I tell you this!! “

All the other Mayoral Candidates have displayed common sense when it comes to Covid. All agree on social distancing and masks and put the citizens before profits. Sullivan is not Mayor material and her actions display a lack of education as well as judgment.

The football game may result in yet more Covid cases.

Football should come second to people’s health, giving them a fan, in crowed bleachers with unmasked people may be the absolute worst thing anyone could do.

Sullivan owes the public and Common Sense Campaign an apology, but don’t hold your breath she probably will not show up.
