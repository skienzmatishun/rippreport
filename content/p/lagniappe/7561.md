 Robert Brown was quoted in the Lagniappe claiming the sewage spills are not happening due to overdevelopment.  If this is the case can we take the “spills” that aren’t “happening” and bring it to the council members’ homes and put the proposed storage tanks on their lawns? 
If there wasn’t any overdevelopment then we would not need the storage tanks.  
The poor folks on Twin Beech can’t have city sewage yet they have to put up with the smell of the overdeveloped poo poo that, according to the Council, isn’t “happening.”
Geez, Brown, are you THAT desperate that you come up with this third rate bull?  You and the rest of the council are twisting in the wind like the SHTF.
