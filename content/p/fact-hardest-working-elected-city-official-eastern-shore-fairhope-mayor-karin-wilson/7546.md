 I myself called the Better Homes and Gardens office in Birmingham.  The staff up there knows the TRUE condition of Fairhope.
Hey Council, if you had a conscious you would feel like the crap you allowed to be spewed in the Bay for what you did to Fairhope.
You are all going to be GONE this next election!
