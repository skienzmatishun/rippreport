 Mayor Wilson has to work hard because she has to fight the council who obstruct her
The council has allowed so much growth that it has stressed the sewers.  The council doesn’t care because they do what Truland and DR Horton tell them what to do
Don’t give me the line about building out in the county.  All the council has to say is the sewer plant won’t take it.   But then the council will say it is the County Commission allowing it. 
That is false as well
The real truth is that both the commission and the council are all owned by that catalyst group.
