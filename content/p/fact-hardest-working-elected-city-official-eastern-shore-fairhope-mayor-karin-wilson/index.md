Congratulations to all Nappie nominees and winners.

Fact:

{{< socialpreview url="https://www.lagniappemobile.com/news/complete-list-2018-nappie-award-winners/article_5217d9c6-250c-5d1f-ad19-26716fe23fe3.html" >}}

Mayor Wilson ran for office with the promise to fix the sewer and utility infrastructure. Fairhope and the Eastern Shore have a sewer problem that was developed over many years of neglect of previous administrations. The Fairhope City Council has hindered the infrastructure projects by simple obstruction and procrastination.

Please read the Mayor’s comments after the article below. Mayor Wilson is doing what she promised and the public needs to know that she is the FIRST Mayor in Fairhope to address the situation.

Contact your City Councilman and tell them to stop playing politics with crap in the bay, do their job.

It is embarrassing to be rated as a dirty beach but maybe it will wake up the Eastern Shore because one community cannot fix the problem.

FACT :Mayor Karin Wilson of Fairhope, Alabama

July 23 2019

This is not something I want to post but it's important to put things in perspective.

The City of Fairhope is my hometown and the health of Mobile Bay has been a priority since I took office and will be until my last.

We have identified and started an aggressive rehabilitation plan for our wastewater collection, transmission and treatment system, and we have the most stringent storm water quality requirements of any in Coastal Alabama.

However, one of our concerns as a municipality is that water quality in the bay can’t be controlled or affected by the act of just one city. The water quality of Mobile Bay is not only a joint effort between the western and eastern sides of the bay but also all our neighbors upstream.

The Mobile Bay Watershed is the second largest in the Country, with nearly 2/3 of Alabama draining into our bay!

Failing septic systems, which are used by 1 in 4 Americans, are a serious source of water pollution with a 5-35% failure rate. Every failing septic system or any illicit discharge in this watershed affects the water quality in Mobile Bay.

Flushing "disposable" wipes, which are NOT and should not be flushed are also contributing factors a municipality cannot control. Our bay is the end outfall for all of this starting in North AL.

There are many factors outside our control, but Fairhope is committed to being a leader in the elements we can control!

We have laid out a top to bottom 5-year plan which started this year.

We are all in this together and it will take a comprehensive, collaborative effort to effect positive change.

The following link is our plan, which includes $11M in RESTORE funding, is in place and has begun.

FACT: Councilman Boone and Burrell did nothing for four years, except for spending 13 million on a sewer plant located next to the Bay. For 22 million they could have relocated the sewer plant inland, which is what will eventually happen.

The public beach in the city of Fairhope stood out for all the wrong reasons in a nationwide study released today about bacterial contamination.
