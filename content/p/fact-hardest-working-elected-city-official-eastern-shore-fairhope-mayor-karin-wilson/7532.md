 So if the problem is caused by other sewage systems and “upstream” then why doesn’t the other areas register the high bacterial count?
Furthermore, Mobile River’s outflow is on the west side of Mobile Bay.
Even the Tensaw River hits Daphne and Daphne does not register the high counts.
I know people that work in Fairhope’s utilities.  They tell me the sewer system is in bad shape and the council covers it up so they can let their developer friends keep building
If the council did care they would put impact fees or do a moratorium.  But no, they made promises to their builder buddies like Corte, Cox, and Prebble.
Don’t tell me the poop in the bay is coming from the north, south, or west.   Sell that to someone else
