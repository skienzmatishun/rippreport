 You must be drinking the bay water if you think that Fairhope and our City Council bear little to no responsibility here!  There is no more covering up of the role played by former Mayor Kant and the current/past City Councils (time for eternal President Burrell to step up and take responsibility for his actions/nonactions).  Mayor Wilson is working to right the ship, but there are decades of mismanagement to be atoned for........don't blame it on Daphne!
