 So, Fairhope has responded to the dirtiest beach in Alabama that it is not their fault - trying to blame other side of Bay etc.  they WILL NOT except responsibility.  The current  City Council as well as the previous one &amp; the previous Mayor has Totally RUINED  Fairhope as has the Building department letting anything &amp; everything be built here.  There is no control at all,  Overbuilding has caused the over flowing of sewage plan &amp; simple.   They want to build more &amp; more - they want to put in MORE flowers &amp; trees (to hide the mess in Fairhope).      It is time to address the REAL problems in Fairhope &amp; STOP trying to Dress It Up!!

Let us now go NATIONAL with this like we did trying to Promote Fairhope &amp; put it where it is today.  Enough is enough &amp; we need to let everyone know exactly what Fairhope has now become.
