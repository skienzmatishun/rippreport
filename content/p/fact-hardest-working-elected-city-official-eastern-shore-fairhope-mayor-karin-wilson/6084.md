 Hey Chris W.:
If in fact Ripp is a "delusional idiot," then what part of what he writes is delusional?  Time and time again Ripp's critics accuse him of lying, but what part of what he writes is lies?  I think that you and the rest of his critics just don't like the fact that what he writes is the truth.  If what he writes is false then he would have been sued for libel long ago.

In addition, when you are asked, none of you answer this simple question: WHAT PART OF WHAT HE WRITES IS FALSE?  It is becuase you can't answer the question.  Now go back and slither into your Catalyst hole.
