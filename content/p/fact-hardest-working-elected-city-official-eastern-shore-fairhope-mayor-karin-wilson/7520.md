 Lyn Stacey passed away earlier this year. The Catalyst brain trust needs replacing.  So let's see who can take his place...
- Boone? No - he is not smart enough to keep the politicians in line.
- Haygood? No, Haygood is happy because he has his own turf that he is exploiting, ruining, and ruling.  It's called Daphne.  Also, he made Catalyst mad last year in his absolute rule of Daphne.
- Ball?  Ha!  Let's move on...
- Joe Davis?  If he can put down the bottle long enough, maybe - but he can't put down the bottle.
- Dorsey? He certainly has enough political free time on his hands but he cannot be found anywhere near the swimming pool in Belaton.  He was last seen taking orders from Boone (oh no!) so who knows where he ended up.
- Burrell? Nope, too visible.  People see him as a bully to Karin.  Bad optics.
- Coleman?  You know the councilman from Daphne who was picked by Catalyst.  He works for Horton homes, is young, and lives in Haygood's pocket.  Well, that can rule him out.  Haygood had a rift with Catalyst.  On second thought maybe Haygood can take Catalyst back over and use Coleman for another purpose.
In the words of The Baldwin Insider"  STAY TUNED!
