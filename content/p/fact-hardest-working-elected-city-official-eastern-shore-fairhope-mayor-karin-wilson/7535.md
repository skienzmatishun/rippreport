 I agree. We have locals who work at Garden &amp; Gun in Charleston and also at Southern Living.  This should definitely be at the top of their tourist destination news items (also cc to Atlanta Journal/Constitution, etc.   Perhaps if Fairhope voters are faced with the rapid descent of tourism and property values, they will also eliminate the coin operated Council.  While this is horribly embarrassing to the City now, it may be the pivotal moment for the changes in governance that Mayor Wilson has strived for.   I love my home and Fairhope and my friends here, but I am at the end of my rope; am I the only one who has noticed that NO condos are selling these days?  We ARE getting the word out!
