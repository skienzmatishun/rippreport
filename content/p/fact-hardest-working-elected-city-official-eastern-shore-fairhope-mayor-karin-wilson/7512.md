 Mayor Wilson has been fighting the good fight but encountering stone walls due to Council President Burrell and those who obey his misguided instructions.  I hope that the nationwide public embarrassment to Fairhope will perhaps nudge Burrell to stop being such a showboating jackass and, for once, do what is best and just for the City.  He can no longer hide behind his Gulf Coast News Today blog which routinely publishes 'opinion' articles on its 'news' site.  What is real in his mind bears little to no relationship to reality.  Fairhope deserves better.  Why won't the rest of the Council force him out of first chair and man up and put someone decent in that position?   Jay Robinson has small children here; he would be a good choice for President for the rest of their terms.  Once out of the President's seat, Burrell will be less able to bully the rest of the Council members and City employees.
