 Fairhope is doing its role for the first time.  Those who are staying tuned in know it.  The bay is a large body of water and the outfall includes everything upstream.  It's common sense. There are many factors and it all must be addressed. Fairhope is an easy scapegoat. Blaming everything on Fairhope is blaming 1 kid peeing in a pool with 50 kids doing the same. Every sewer system that ties in to this enormous watershed contributes. And this is only part of the problem. Fairhope just happens to be located at the end of the outfall.
