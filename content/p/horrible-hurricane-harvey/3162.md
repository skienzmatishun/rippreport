 Plenty I don't like about Karin but she has been steadfast in sounding the alarm about infrastructure and the first to raise it to its proper priority. After the recent presentation it is very clear dramatic action needs to start soon. I support a decisive, yes expensive, approach to include a second sewer plant.  Another thing Karin did well was to get the right people running utilities and planning. It offsets a lot of screw ups. If she will just bug out re: the marina I would be happier still.
