 I am glad someone brought up the salaries of the shitty councilmen. It's not their salaries...it's the under the table kickbacks that are rampant in this corrupt government. I know no one likes to talk about it but Kant and Nix rigged all elections for decades. 

They didn't do it for their health and peace of mind.

This is Fairhope.
Corruption.
Turds in bay.
Embarrassment.
Declining property values.
