 Can someone explain to me how lawsuits against the City actually work?  I am interested in the sequence of events like Mr. Ripp's claim, and the three claims from the disgruntled former and present employees against Mayor Wilson.  Who determines the validity of the claim?  The City's attorney(s)?  Personal attorneys?  Obviously if a claim then becomes a lawsuit and goes to trial, depending on the outcome who pays the claim?  The City?  Individuals? The City's insurance company?  What if the City's insurance company denies the claim...then who pays?

Thanks.
