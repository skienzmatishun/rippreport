 I still don't think Jack is a crook. I know he never read about Andrew Carnegie, and I hope he throws an olive branch to Ripster (anyone taking odds) next meeting. I am now getting troubled about how we got in this utility mess. First, Kant should have appointed someone who could do the job. He clearly didn't. The soccer fields I lay at his feet as well as Burrell and the rest of the last council. First, it's money really needed for infrastructure. Second, we have a facility worth a million bucks. Whether it was stolen or just pee peed away, it is a boondoggle. So I am putting a good part of this mess on the previous council president and some on Kant and some on the other council people. It is a major strike against Jack though. His plusses are getting outweighed by his minuses.
