 The Mayor makes nothing.....maybe $30,000 per year.  The reason that Kant loved being mayor was that he appointed himself 'Superintendent of Utilities' which paid him another 60 or 90k per year, in addition to the gifts that he received for 'looking the other way &amp; selling out the city'.   The funniest thing is that now, even the political establishment, has now thrown Kant, Burrell and Pittman under the bus for criminal behavior.  Voters are waking up; even Catalyst deemed Trip Pittman the worst person on the planet (not a direct quote, but the idea was transmitted totally)!
We need to find out where the $13 million in sewer system improvements were allocated because we know now that our system cannot even handle the current load!
Color me Disgusted with City Council (Kant &amp; Burrell, not Wilson).
