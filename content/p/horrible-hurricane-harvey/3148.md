 It would be great to think that Boone &amp; Burrell were enlisting the assistance of media(?) with getting the word out about the state of our city utilities now that they have finally been assessed to be in such horrible condition.  And, if I were a 'reporter', I would certainly be asking those questions and trying to write a good piece of journalism exploring how this happened and who was not doing his job when Fairhope fell apart.  
As a side note, however one feels about Mayor Wilson, everyone should be grateful that she was elected.  Without her quest to bring these issues out to the public, it is frightening to imagine what the utility system would be like in 4 years (if it still worked at all).  I thought Brown was a good addition to the council but he is rotten to the core if he is working with Kant and Burrell to bury the sewer issues so that they all still look good.
