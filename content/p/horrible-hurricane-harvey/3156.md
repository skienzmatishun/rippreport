 Conyers makes more as a banker than the mayor. Ditto for all the others. None of them will run for mayor. Love her or hate her Mayor Karin will probably not even have a serious challenge. Question is, who has the moxie to challenge Burrell ? I bet he does not have a serious challenger. My guess is Conyers makes 110, Burrell 140, and the other 3 are self employed but I bet they are all making more than Burrell.  As long as we are building out every square inch of Fairhope Brown and Boone will be making out. I have always felt they have a built in bias which contrasts with what the majority of the community wants now. Not inherently bad, but probably not what we need for the foreseeable future.
