 Wake up people!!  Brown is a builder and developer!  If you think he will ever side with anyone other than the developers and actually consider what is best for our town then you are CRAZY.   When are the citizens of Fairhope going to wise up to what is going on right now in this town and those we have elected to run it?  They are all acting like middle school children on the playground trying to get their way and pointing the finger at someone else. This is  NOT TAKING care of business. Every day that we waste on this insane behavior is not improving our sewer or any infrastructure needs. They are all wasting our time and money .  People should storm the next Council Meeting and all demand to take three minutes at the end to state your concerns about what is going on in our city government.  While your at the podium tell Burrell he can take his toys and his temper and go home.  Tell the others that we will no longer accept them sitting through that type of behavior that Burrell displayed at the last Council Meeting and not speaking up.  We have two attorneys sitting up there and They might as well have been bumps on a log.  If Brown sat there with a smirk on his face while that display was going on then everyone should have been outraged.  WE ARE DERSERVING OF WHAT WE ARE PRESENTLY GETTING!
