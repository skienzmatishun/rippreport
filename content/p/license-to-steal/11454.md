 Oh, Ripp, get over yourself 
Alabama is for Alabamians 
You Yankees that move in are outsiders.   Either accept this or go back up north to your Yankee Paradise
See? We Alabamians are not impressed with Yankees.  We know you messed up your  state  so when you come down here remember  to leave your enlightened. (Ha ha) destructive politics at the Mason Dixon Line.   For those of you who are from
The north, the Mason Dixon  Line  is the line between Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Maryland that  divides the north from the south.    We know that northern schools no longer educate    Northern schools indoctrinate.  Yankee  school kids can not even find these states on a map.   But southern kids can find these states and know true people from Yankee scum
