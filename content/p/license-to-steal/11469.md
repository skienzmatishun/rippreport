 I moved here because your lack of skilled workers lets me make lots of money and there's nothing you can do about it.  You took yankee jobs by tax breaks and your community suffered for it.  I didn't say anything about not liking Alabama. Ignoring your problems isn't loving your state.  It's abandoning it.

I'm not a liberal.  You're just wrong.
