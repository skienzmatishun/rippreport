 You group the entire north into New York City and complain about cherry picking?

Alabama is a bargain for Albany residents.  Albany is out of Alabama residents price range.

Can you give me some non cherry picked numbers?

All I can find is 8th in crime out of the 50 states.  Mobile, the murder capitol at number 1.  Healthcare system ranked at 45. #5 for welfare recipients (above any yankee state). 29th in economic growth, that's better. #47 in education. But, I don't know, tell me some good stats.

I don't see what good it does for anyone to ignore problems?
