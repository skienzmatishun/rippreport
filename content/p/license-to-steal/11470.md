 Maybe it's my yankee enlightenment, but I think we really need to stop this generalized villain thing. I don't care what you think about me.  But it's going to get much worse very soon.  All you hear is Nancy Pelosi is a monster! McConnel is an asshole. AOC, MJT, whatever.

That's not the problem.  If Pelosi goes, another person just like her will replace her. What's the point?

The problem, which TV won't tell you, is 100% due to gerrymandering.

The system has been changed to where most politicians/political parties don't compete.  It doesn't matter what they call themselves.


That's how you get failed states. That's how you get plaques warning you of cancer in every building like California.  They, all of them, are robbing us blind.  And all we can do is yell about yankees and rednecks liberals, deplorables, etc.

Turn your tv off and take a vacation or something.
