Fauxhope municipal elections have started off with a bang. Five candidates have qualified for city council positions, and support one another in a solid slate. A very smart move. Who would want to be a minority councilman facing a well entrenched cabal of good ole boys, developers, politicians, lawyers, judges and let’s not leave out the District Attorney’s Office.

The new contenders, running as a solid slate of 5, have caused panic among the current council, who are supported by the developers and special interests, aka Catalyst. In the past 4 election cycles the council has members ran independent of one another, or so they professed. This election is different. The incumbents are united and their message is clear, vote for all of us!

This council has turned down public opinion that supports a city council with districts. They also support a Mayor, who is unopposed, that receives two paychecks from the city. Mayor and Head of Utilities. The Head of utilities job was a reward by the council to the Mayor for winning the election. That also gave them access to the Utility checkbook. The previous Mayor Karen Wilson had refused the second paycheck and employed a utility engineer. So our City Council fired the qualified engineer and gave the job to the Mayor and another paycheck. Mayor Sullivan is not an engineer and has no qualifications required by municipalities to run a Municipal Utility.
Fauxhope voters have a very easy decision to make election day, Aug 26 2025. You vote for a council that represents the good ole boys and the corruption and current status quo. Pay attention they have fixed elections and know every dirty trick to pull during an election. Already the status quo has circulated a flier and post on Facebook, accusing the challengers as being supported by Mom’s of Liberty. It’s Bullshit. Listen to the candidates. I fully expect that signs will go missing and the closer we get to election day the more desperate they will be.

The Ripp Report supports a new council. The incumbents need to go !

The absolutely worst City Councilman is Jack Burrell. Burrell is a classic bully and his treatment of the former Mayor checked all the boxes of what a bully is. He is a pain in the ass to the council, city employees and the Mayor, who has her fingers crossed that Jack will be replaced.

Jack has cost this city millions. Please use the search bar on this page and type in Jack Burrell. Read all the different controversies councilman Burrell has been involved in. Burrell is the council contact for the good ole boys, developers or so called economic development projects. He is a long overdue incumbent that needs to go to pasture.

If his lips are moving he is lying.

Jack Burrel’s real occupation has always been portrayed as that of a rocket scientist. The truth may be closer to a tech salesman for aerospace tools parts or who knows????

Jack can back peddle with no shame. Time and time again Jack will show his true colors. Jack is for Jack.
