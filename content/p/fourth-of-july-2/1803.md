 Do you have proof of this? How did Mike Lyons' membership explain two wives? Upon seeing her recent actions as Mayor, I don't doubt that this is true but is there any proof to publish. I hope that Lakewood sues her for the membership fee (which I think is $15,000 for pool &amp; tennis) and the past dues).  Or did she just pretend to be her sister when she was there and didn't truly have a membership in her own name (still fraud)?
