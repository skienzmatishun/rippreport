 Bizarre comment! Gary, Indiana died b/c of socialist policies. White people moved away to better educate their children and so that their homes would not become worthless. 
I think that Wilson truly wants the best for Fairhope but she has too many loser friends who depend upon her for their paychecks.  So very sad for Fairhope.....she is pretty much toast and heaven only knows who we will get next.  We just put our money behind a person who isn't qualified to run a supper club and now we are left with Boone and Burrell being the toasts of the town b/c we would rather have the Goobers than the Stupids.
