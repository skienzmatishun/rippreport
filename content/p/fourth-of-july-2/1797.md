 The death of the girl on Corte property was quickly ruled as suicide. Was it a suicide??  The small house on Corte property where the "suicide " took place is now gone??? Was in torn down  ???  The chief of police at the time the "suicide" took place was Bill Press who use to go ride horses on the Corte property. Friendly with the Cortes?! You bet!!  So was the death of the young woman fully investigated or brushed over by friendship?
