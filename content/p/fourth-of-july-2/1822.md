 There are two things the mayor of Fairhope, Alabama, and Gary, Indiana have in common - they share the same last name, Wilson, and they want to stop growth. In 1970, Gary, Indiana had 175,000 population, the 2016 population is 76,000 (est). Queen Wilson will have Fairhope's population gone if she stays in office.
