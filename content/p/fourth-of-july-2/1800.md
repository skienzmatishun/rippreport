 The dumping of raw sewage has to stop! I understand that Kant needed to cut a nice deal for himself and the councilmen ($13 million) but this deal was a huge turd for Fairhope citizens. 

Why spend thirteen million to continue dumping excrement in the bay?

Please, please, please stop this disgusting practice. 

Fairhope is only as good as this primitive method of disposing of human feces that causes diseases.

Thank you.
