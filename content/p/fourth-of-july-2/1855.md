 These comments are awful.  It's one thing to accuse someone of misdeeds.  It's absolutely infantile, mean-spirited and slanderous to throw out criticism that you've "heard", that "somebody" told you, that you've simply made up to support your case, whatever that may be.  Just because we are able to comment here anonymously should not give grown adults a pass to say things that they would NEVER EVER say to that person face-to-face - things without any substance or proof.  If you accuse someone of a falsehood just because you can do it anonymously, you're the worst kind of coward.  You should be ashamed of yourself...but I am sure you are not.  These hateful comments from hidden people who are my neighbors, who share this community with me, who are mere inches away from inciting violence, should not be tolerated.  By anyone.  I'm embarrassed by the people in my town who are proving themselves to be exactly like those who live outside Fairhope accuse us of being.  Shame, shame, shame on you.
