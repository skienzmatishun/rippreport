 Airport a joke - hope something is done about the fraud/scams/illegal activity there.  #2 - the "Gift" of the wetlands from Corte shows what a "shady character" he is &amp; CANNOT be trusted - - another activity that happened ON Corte property was the death of the young girl several years ago that was Swept under the rug - this needs to be reopened &amp; re investigated.  I do NOT care WHO plays cards with the Cortes on their property each week.
# 3 - YES an audit needs to be done ASAP!!!
#4 - YES an audit needs to be done &amp; not the regular auditors that normally does the City accounting!!!    What is the problem is they are all in cahoots together from the City's Insurance carrier - who is located next door on up &amp; down!
And I hope to God something is actually fixing to break &amp; get this mess totally out in the public!!

For all those that say must not have happened because nothing has come out yet -  just wait - their will be alot of embarrassment!!  And many will be surprised what does comes out!
