 You are right, they do use the sidewalks and when you are trying to walk you have to stop to let others walk by you or you have to walk in the street. They all should be charged for the usage. Also, the Broken Egg Cafe has NICE tables and chairs and not plastic, those plastic chairs and tables should all be metal. 
What would happen if everyone used the sidewalks like that? Then there would not be usable sidewalks, there needs to be a city ordinance to forbids this or pay the city. 
I actually had someone bump into my leg pushing a stroller by the bookstore because there was no room to walk. It left a massive bruise, it hurt like hell, the couple apologized but it could be avoided.
