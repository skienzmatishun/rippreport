 You bore me mayor! You are the one that lies and hides behind your own lies. You have accused people of high crimes and misdemeanors, spend our money for your own gain. Somewhere in the back of that little bittie mind of yours, you think you are going to move up in politics. Does your bookstore share the same HVHC used with your condo upstairs? And does the bookstore pay that bill and all the electric bill that is associated with it? And do you not deduct that bill for a business expense? Do you use a city phone for anything personal? Do you use your city computer to communicate with other politicians to chit-chat? You hypocrisy have no bounds. Threaten to sue the council, the city which is the people because you don't get your way! You fired folks because you do not like them, you place spyware on computers, you know you have used Lakewood and you are not a member, and you know that going to those conferences are just a way for you to meet with Democrats. You waste our money, you need to get you ass to work, where is a master plan, where are all the things you promised in your campaign. No mayor you are the coward, bully, fool and self-loving idiot. Shame, shame, shame on you too!

I don't give a Ripp what you think we are!
