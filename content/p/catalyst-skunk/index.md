County Commission place three has three candidates trying to run over the skunk of the County Commission, Tucker Dorsey. Democrat Heather Brown and Republicans Will McDaniel and Billy Joe Underwood.

Tucker Dorsey showed his stripes before even taking office. He, Bob James and Frank Burt had meetings before being sworn in. As soon as they had been sworn in the three had an alliance and fired over 10 people from the county employment, department heads, lawyers, county manager and the EMA director.

County Commissioner Gruber at the time said:

“There are several hundred years of experience in that group that retired last Friday,” Gruber said. “This county won’t have that again for a long time."

> “Baldwin County Commissioner Tucker Dorsey says the labyrinth of business entities surrounding him and his part-time employer are simply a method of reducing liabilities or the vestiges of old property associations and do not represent an ethical dilemma for him as an officeholder.”

Can you smell the Skunk? Or is that BS and Skunk.

Dorsey has faced many ethics charges but what the hell the ethics commission has no nose and certainly no ethics. Sadly the Ethics Commission has become the escape route for political corruption.

As he sought his first elected office in 2010, Baldwin County Commissioner Tucker Dorsey faced tough accusations from his rival that ties to the county’s biggest developers and one of its largest private sewer systems would make it hard for him to avoid conflicts of interest. Six years later those ties and questions about business …

A Skunk and a sewer system have a distinct smell and Mr Dorsey and Baldwin County Sewer are stinking up the whole county.

Until they stink, overflow or back up, sewers are easy to ignore. Let someone see it or smell it, though, and everyone wants their sewers fixed yesterday. In a fast-growing place like Baldwin County, money, politics and the environment can also influence public interest in sewer service. It may not be the first thing a …

Another skunk smell is coming from the Mega “dump” Site, a Dorsey bonanza for some. The entire County has been getting a nostril full of BS and Skunk since the purchase, but don’t worry Dorsey says he is protecting your “quality of life.” Trouble is he is talking about HIS quality of life and HIS new home and property, while the rest of us pony up the money for a political corrupt good ole boy deal.

BOTTOM LINE IS A VOTE FOR DORSEY IS A VOTE FOR CATALYST AND BALDWIN COUNTY SEWER. PLEASE RUN OVER THE SKUNK.

The Democrats are beginning to show up in different elections and regardless of what you may think, it is politically healthy. Heather Brown has stepped up to run over the Skunk.

Mr. Will McDaniel is running as a Republican and also wishes to squash the skunk. Mr McDaniel ran for the opportunity to run over the skunk in 2014 but the odor was so overwhelming the skunk keep people away. It is interesting to look back at 2014 and what was being said then.

My prediction will be Billie Joe Underwood will get the honors of running over the Skunk. Billie Joe is an accountant, CPA. She deals with forms, figures, tax problems and must study these issues to come up with a solution. The county Commission desperately needs these qualifications. The County Commission could use a woman on the commission, the men have not been doing very well. Billie Joe would be a Public Servant, not a good ole girl, and Lord knows we need more Public Servants.
