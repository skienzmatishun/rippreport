 Well I have to say even during the impeachment trial the liberals and the Democrats praised House Stacey Plaskett and of course she played the race card. You know, every single time in history when they seem to be getting their asses handed to them the race card is pulled out and jammed down our throats. It’s hard to listen to anyone who does this. I’m a equal opportunity listener.  But you people sure make it hard not to judge you from the beginning.  Super Bowl is one thing but this impeachment trial is another. What the hell does race have to do with it. They say the defense seemed to show more black women using the word “fight” than only other race. Well then tell your fellow black constituents to hold back on their comments or at least try to average them out a little. You liberals and Democrats are nothing short of being hypocritical in every way possible especially when playing the race card and you all play it every time when you seem to be losing a fight. When it has nothing at all to do with race you still throw it in our face. I’m all about hearing everyone’s argument but dammit there was not any reason to throw the black card on the table. Damn liberals are just sore winners!
