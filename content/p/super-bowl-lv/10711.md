 Paul, you make a good point here
Watch both coaches shake hands after the game
I wish we could do this in politics
Fight hard during the election, accept the choice of the people and go back to being citizens
We use to amaze the world.  I am a Republican and I am goi g to be a citizen and accept that Biden is my President.  I will await the next election and respect the election results of 2020.
