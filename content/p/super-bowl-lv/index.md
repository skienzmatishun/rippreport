Super Bowl LV, the 55th Super Bowl and the 51st modern-era National Football League championship game, will decide the league champion for the 2020 NFL season. The American Football Conference champion Kansas City Chiefs will play the National Football Conference champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

Football and politics always compete for the attention of the citizens of the United States. This years Super Bowl will probably have more viewers than voters in the 2020 Presidential election. The Super Bowl is a needed relief from the strain of Covid and politics.

Our heads are busting with the “contested election” and “covid hoax”, that has claimed 455,000 Americans. We stand divided, two sides that diabolically disagree with each other. So much so that we witnessed, live on TV, an insurrection. Insurrection on the soul of our democracy, our nation's Capital.

Rebellion, uprising, or insurrection is a refusal of obedience or order. It refers to the open resistance against the orders of an established authority.

The Presidential election and Super Bowl LV have a lot of similarities. Both have two sides, parties or teams, Republicans and Democrats. Both have millions of fans, or voters. Both have captains, the Senators and Representatives. Both have billions of dollars at stake and use TV as their forum, witness, and record.

Football fans are far more civil than politicians, and maybe, a big maybe, the voters and politicians, can learn from fans watching a game supervised by umpires enforcing the rules.

Pay attention to the first few minutes AFTER the game. No matter who wins, the captain of the LOSING team, will not leave the field until he shakes the hand of his opponent. Players from both sides will congratulate each other and accept their bruises as part of the game.

The fans will not cause an insurrection, riot, or contest the games final score. Sure, there will be exceptions, however they will not rise to the level of insurrection, violence and loss of life. The fans are not going to try and hang the umpires or contest the outcome of the game, they witnessed.

How can the same millions of fans, or voters, watch a football game and accept the outcome of a glorious battle between two of the best football teams and not accept 50 States certifying the Presidential election?

Another question is what are you teaching your children sportsmanship or Insurrection?

Enjoy the game may the best team win and the losing team be gracious.
