Every now and then you get a candidate interested in public service that is highly skilled and over qualified. Someone who is willing to use his skills he learned in private business to a position of public servant. Dr. Byrian Ramsey is one of those candidates. He is the President of the Lake Forest property owners association and the strongest advocate of Lake Forest. Lake Forest needs someone who protects and promotes “Lake Forest First.” It is the second largest subdivision in Alabama. The Daphne Mayor and council have been stone deaf to some of the issues facing Lake Forest and Daphne, such as flooding and converting park property into commercial property. Lake Forest needs a councilman that will aggressively represent the Lake Forest community. Dr. Ramsey is that candidate, his Facebook page and .com site have a wealth of information covering issues within Lake Forest and Daphne. He is articulate. does his research and comes with an impressive resume. Dr. Ramsey would be a breath of fresh air to a council that has ignored issues by kicking the can down the road.

Daphne has it’s share of good ole boys and Dr. Ramsey does not fit that mold. Qualified is the key word and Dr. Byrian Ramsey is:
DOCTOR OF MANAGEMENT IN ORGANIZATIONAL LEADERSHIP IN INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY.

Research his positions on subjects and you will see he puts the constituents first. You may also listen to his live interview.
