Once again the voters can see the true colors, and arrogance, of Commissioner’s Dorsey and Elliott.

{{< socialpreview url="https://www.lagniappemobile.com/news/local/man-chainsaws-public-barricade-dumps-debris-in-county-office/article_02a8acb6-72ff-53c4-89ee-8f7ecad8d146.html" >}}

Instead of admitting to a mistake Elliott, supported by Dorsey, doubled down with threats against citizens and defended their actions in a County Commission Meeting.

{{< socialpreview url="https://www.lagniappemobile.com/news/local/baldwin-county-commission-discusses-zundel-road-barricade/article_e2a89097-2294-5a81-bc6b-cdbfbe63efdb.html" >}}

Dorsey texted, “Teenagers drinking, making out with their girlfriends, drug buy meets, easy dirt road to go hide down where police don’t patrol.”

What a load of crap. The real reason is Dorsey and Elliott have major donors, who live on the Bay, and they want the property vacated. This would deny public access and the donors would not be bothered with the pesky public.

Zundel Road is in Elliott’s district however Dorsey took the lead in barricading access, which he later denied, while Elliott had his thumb in his mouth and was busy cleaning his office of the barricade debris.

Why would you vote for a County Commissioner or candidate for a State Senate seat, that would deny “established and legal” public access to Mobile Bay.

Petitions work, remember the Tatumville, Big Head Gully Petition? It garnered over 2200 signatures and convinced the Single Tax corporation and the Fairhope City Council that the PUBLIC should be listened to.

PLEASE TAKE JUST A MINUTE OR TWO AND SIGN THE PETITION. LET’S SEND A CLEAR MESSAGE TO THE COUNTY COMMISSION, LEAVE ZUNDEL ROAD PUBLIC ACCESS ALONE.

KICK DORSEY, ELLIOTT AND CATALYST TO THE CURB JUNE 5th.
