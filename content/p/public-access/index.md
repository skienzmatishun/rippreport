### Man chainsaws public barricade, dumps debris in county office - Lagniappe Mobile

Last week a man walked into Baldwin County Commission Chairman Chris Elliott’s office and dumped debris from a piece of county property he had chainsawed down earlier that day. It was a rather dramatic escalation in a long battle over waterfront access in Point Clear, but Michael Hutchison said he’s tired of history repeating itself …

### Baldwin County Commission discusses Zundel Road barricade - Lagniappe Mobile

Lagniappe The Baldwin County Commission recently attempted to restrict vehicular access to Zundel Road, leading to a dust-up with a local resident.

Dorsey texted, “Teenagers drinking, making out with their girlfriends, drug buy meets, easy dirt road to go hide down where police don’t patrol.”

What a load of crap. The real reason is Dorsey and Elliott have major donors, who live on the Bay, and they want the property vacated. This would deny public access and the donors would not be bothered with the pesky public.

Zundel Road is in Elliott’s district however Dorsey took the lead in barricading access, which he later denied, while Elliott had his thumb in his mouth and was busy cleaning his office of the barricade debris.

Why would you vote for a County Commissioner or candidate for a State Senate seat, that would deny “established and legal” public access to Mobile Bay.

Petitions work, remember the Tatumville, Big Head Gully Petition? It garnered over 2200 signatures and convinced the Single Tax corporation and the Fairhope City Council that the PUBLIC should be listened to.
