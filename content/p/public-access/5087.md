 The developers have descended like falcons on Baldwin county. The politicians have paved the way literally and figuratively. I see no end in sight. Brace yourselves for all of the problems associated with growth. Traffic. Overcrowded schools with behavior problems. A loss of the small town charm Fairhope once had. What a travesty that has occurred before our very eyes. So utter heartbreaking!
