 In Fairhope, I don't know what else can be done to fix things traffic wise. The road system is overloaded. You ain't gonna widen 98.  Can't do it.  It's already a four lane. Corte's apartments will put several more hundred cars on an already overused road. Not to mention all the apartments going up in daphne lately. The whole eastern shore has attracted too many people. The politicians have not cared about infrastructure because it is expensive and they were supposed to charge developers but didn't because they give them their campaign cash.  It is a tired vicious cycle.
