 I had never heard of Jerry Carl until I received dozens of expensive cardboard ads touting his 'Christian Values'.  I  voted against him immediately. He could be the best candidate ever but he will never get my vote by preaching; our greediest politicians were elected for their 'Conservative Christian Values'......ad nauseam, as they sell us down the Fairhope pink sewer.
