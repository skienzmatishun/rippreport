 I'll make my prediction early : council vote will be 2-2. I don't have 100% trust that they will vote this down. I do wonder why these projects make it through our permitting staff. Obviously their calculations are incorrect since there should be some room for error in their calculations and the spills overcome that and we still have 100s of thousands of gallons of runoff to boot. What I am saying is the staff should not get a complete pass on all this flooding because they are approving plans that are insufficient. Mr Mosher made a good compelling video on Big Head Gulley.  I think (I hope) Mr Turner's argument is a bluff because with or without the acre the city has they should not permit any building on that land. So job #1 is not to let them use the acre and job # 2 is to make anything built on the other land pass development standards. I do not believe anything could pass if the standards are sufficient. If anything does pass we need to start looking to replace the staff who are signing off on this stuff. If you permit strictly enough then it should not flood. BTW I think builders/developers should be required to pay a fee for every tree over a 6 inches diameter which they cut down even if their project meets other standards.
