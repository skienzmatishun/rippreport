 It's easy to sit back and critisize when you have no idea what all the mayor has gone through and what she's currently going through. If you have been paying attention, you'll see she stands up for what is right and fair single day. No one in office has ever done this for the City.  All while council fights her every step of the way.  The control freaks are council!

People do have their limits. I encourage our community to support her efforts for this thankless (basically volunteer) job. There are not that many people who would put up with this.
