 What the heck is going on with the “Oh how bad the Mayor has it and how bad she is treated. She and all us supporters signed up for this and knew it would be a tough and terrible road. Why is now everyone crying and feeling sorry for the Mayor after the meeting last night. Makes me wonder. Quit whining, shut up and keep moving forward. If you are now just jumping on board. It’s been this was for over a year. Don’t bring anyone down. We are on a roll. If you want to see the Mayor do well, shut up and get with the program. We all have been supporting the Mayor from the start. There have been some stumbles, but what do you expect from the Council that has no desire to make Fairhope a better place and certainly do not want to help us or our Mayor. Stand Tall!  Be Positive!!!!
