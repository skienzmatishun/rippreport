 The Mayor needs to act more like the leader that we voted her to be. Sure, anyone cwn blow their top at the way the Council treats the Mayor. BUT!  It’s up to her, especially when the citizens have shown their support all week long for one of the very few times and got behind what is truly right for Fairhope. YEAH!!!!   Great for the Mayor and great for Fairhope. The citizens spoke out and made their point with over 2200 petitions being casted. Ride the wave and take the HIGH road. No sense acting like anything other than a winner when you are at a meeting that the citizens are already supporting change for the better. I would work on knowing when I have the upper hand and not giving it back in just one meeting. It was most definitely the Mayors night to shine and I think she didn’t take full advantage of that fact. True Leaders also know when to fight and when to sit back and observe. It’s the same thing the rotten ass City Council does. Let’s be different than the darn Council!!!!
