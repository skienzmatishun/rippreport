 There is always complaining about what people do with their property.  It astounds me that you people want land to stay vacant or undeveloped, but you (either collectively or singularly) never put up your own money to make a park, or put in trust to keep undeveloped.  Unless a variance is requested, there is nothing the City or private citizens can do.

As for all the elected officials who get trashed here:  Since you are not going to put your money on the line to purchase the land, use it for a qualifying fee.  There are at least 3 Alabama House of Representative seats in our area that have candidates unopposed.  When nobody runs against the ones that have qualified, who is responsible?  Them, us?
