 If they happen to be stupid enough to build those homes on the acreage planned. There would be no possible way that it (the crap) would not end up on people’s property below as well as 100% dangerous crap flowing through our streams, Gulleys, driveways, yards, roads. It will even have a terrible stench to it as you would not be able to control all the trash, pets (pee and poo) chemicals that we use to clean our house, our vehicles, etc, etc, etc!  Think about it. All the crap that runs down church street would power things even more quickly over all the now home owners property and straight down to the bay. Mobile Bay Keepers need to keep away. They are getting benifits from developers (BET?) for helping by not reporting such sewage overage and hazardous run off. We just gave them about 80 grand. Worthless as tits on a boar hog! They could care less about what CRAP runs into Mobile Bay. They certainly haven’t proven anything to the citizens.
