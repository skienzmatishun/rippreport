Sleepy Joe has a $1T infrastructure package to sell you as Afghanistan falls to the Taliban (The graveyard of Empires).

Ripp recalls the fall of Saigon.

Baldwin and Mobile Counties are seeing a dramatic increase in the Delta Variant of SARS-COV-2, I mean when they have to close the "WAL-MARKS" it's pretty bad.

The Fairhope City Council in their infinite wisdom has decided to pay employees an incentive to get the jab. Only after they have 35 employees out with the Virus that has infected 36,300,000 in the USA and claimed 619,000 lives.

Hospitals along the I-10 corridor from Houston to the Atlantic are out of ICU beds and tents are being set up to care for the sick, some in Mobile are waiting eight hour in the ER to get admitted for COVID treatment.

On July 28, 2021 a veteran of the Afghan war was killed by Sheriff's Deputies in Elmore County. Retired Airforce Col Andy Pears looked on as his son, Jonathan Pears, was shot while wielding a blade a considerable distance from anyone whom he might have harmed.

Hold on to your wallet County Commissioners (as an aside Elliott's wife works for the Sheriff's Department and HE is working every day for his developer pals from his Catalyst days).

Still no word on Mr. Rippâ€™s complaint with the Montgomery County Circuit Court regarding the Writ of Mandamus but the Ethics Commission did bother to file a Motion to Dismiss. And the Field of Dreams game was played this week, something to look forward to when we have some leadership and get this Pandemic under control.

Tubberville and Booker have an animated debate, welcome to the big leagues Coach!
