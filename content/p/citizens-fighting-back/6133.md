 The more subdivisions the municipalities stuff in Baldwin County means more voters, more people who srenâ€™t Inbred with the good ole boys, and another non-Catalyst.  This means Catalyst dilutes it power.  
I asked a Catalyst what they plan on doing to mitigate this and I was told they will make enough money where they can go anywhere else and repeat their process.  As I earlier stated, they are like locusts.
People of Baldwin County, we must stop these parasites.  Vote them out
