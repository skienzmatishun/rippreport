 Ripp, 
Justin here... re: my comment about the department heads
I was referring to the Past department heads who were standing behind the Chief that night at the City Council meeting. Each one of them went down due to their own demise. They continued to report to Tim and undermine Mayor Wilson, be passive aggressive, sneaky and disrespectful of her ideas and authority.  As I explained, that radio interview told the tell. 
Anyone can see through that, if they are being honest with themselves. 
Thanks for reprinting my thoughts- even if I am  not a writer.
