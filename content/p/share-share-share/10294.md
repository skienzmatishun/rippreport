 Clearly, there's a lot of money to be made by the old white former plantation owners in keeping Alabama at the bottom of every scale of economic, educational, governmental and ethical standard valued by the "American Way of Life."

In other words, full use of the "Keep 'em barefoot and pregnant" strategy. 

The underground economy works quite well for a large portion of that Alabama population.  Ask anybody working in the broadly defined tourist business in Baldwin County.  Don't worry about an education.  Work off the books, pay no taxes, buy lots of Bud Light, cigarettes and illegal drugs, use every public welfare program available, save no money, and - if one lives long enough - live off the public teat in "retirement."

In the meantime, the former plantation owners pay the taxes for the crooked system that keeps the described Baldwin County worker poorly educated, in their minimum wage or off-the-books jobs, dodging the law, going to jail every once in a while, and producing the next generation of,  "I was raised by my single parent Mom" worker.

Yes, it's a bleak picture, but until we get political and business leaders who stop describing this picture as, "Another day in Paradise," it will continue.
