 Agree with all of you. If Scott Boone filed a suit against somebody. Wow!!!! Think of ALL THE  INFO we would get including info on Jackass Burrell and the rest of them. I think you all have the right idea. Was just Wondering why you said Boone would sue someone after this election was over with. I think that might have shown support for Boone, but again, he is a sorry ass person with just enough sense to not file a lawsuit. Peace out!
