 I feel sorry for the police chief.  He has been used by the Council, primarily Burrell I'm sure, for their own selfish interests.  He ended up being viewed as a fool by everyone who is aware of what has transpired.  Sure, it's his own fault, but the City will be better off with new blood now that he is no longer respected. I do wish him well in his retirement....he seems like a nice guy.
