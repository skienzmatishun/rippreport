# Transcript

In May–June 2020, John Paulson and John McWhorter’s *The Glenn Show* episode sparked renewed scrutiny of George Floyd’s death, shifting their view from minor incident to a systemic cover-up. The new documentary *The Fall of Minneapolis*, released on Rumble by Alpha News (directed by J.C. Shay, narrated by Liv Collins), presents 20 minutes of unedited body cam footage before Floyd’s arrest, challenging the "murder" narrative and raising questions about Derek Chauvin’s trial. Chauvin was attacked in Arizona, stabbed 22 times weeks after the film’s release—raising concerns about trial integrity. During the 2020 protests, the Minneapolis police precinct burned, evidence destroyed, and officials abandoned the site, a pattern of cover-up. Public reaction to the cell phone video of Chauvin choking Floyd was immediate and damning. Autopsy revealed Floyd had 19 ng/mL fentanyl and methamphetamine, both fatal levels; signs of untreated hypertension and coronary disease. No asphyxiation was found; FBI was told 12 hours post-death. The medical examiner reported no evidence of chokehold-related death. Prosecution, led by a partisan DA and attorney general, suppressed exonerating evidence. In Baldwin County, Sheriff Mack (son of Huey Sr., former coroner) lost 135 pounds after bariatric surgery and highlights a 18-page coroner’s report, initially denied, later released after legal threats. Signed by DA Wedstone, Lt. Hossmack, and Judge Robert Wilters, it confirms judicial review but raises transparency concerns. A Rule 32 petition (Lawrence v. State) argues for post-conviction relief, citing newly discovered autopsy evidence—specifically, intact C3–C7 vertebrae—contradicting the state’s claim that a bullet fractured the hyoid and destroyed C2. No bullet hole or gunshot wound found. The prosecution’s key forensic claim collapses. The Hoss & Whetstone investigation, tied to the prosecution, faces conflict of interest—DA and judge Scott Taylor are the same person, both previously linked to Minneapolis. No official response to the report. In Baldwin County, a 2016 car seizure by deputy was illegally transported to Kansas without hearing or evidence; statute of limitations expired, vehicle properly registered. Supreme Court must decide if such a warrant stands without criminal charge. A man involved in local government corruption, known for gold-plating (mercury vapor), died in a Woodstock standoff after police served a warrant. He briefly flashed a gun; one officer fired a lucky shot. He died four days later. Authorities demanded he walk out naked, backwards—absurd and disturbing. The host warns against speaking to deputies without legal counsel. A text from a dead Alabama inmate (heart missing) raised questions: was it removed post-mortem? Alabama’s new prison exceeds $1 billion, no design available. Gulf Shores approves $8.2M multi-sports facility; state builds $325M tax collector HQ with 20-year RSA lease, no bid required. Escambia County prison project, originally $1.2B, no design, no front-end visuals, unbid contract. 12 political appointees rank medical marijuana applicants; only four licenses issued. Ties resolved by drawing names from a hat. 36 applicants sued after claiming unfairness. CBD products remain available. Hunter Biden faces nine tax charges; $1.6M ATM withdrawal deemed absurd. The Protect Liberty Act blocks government purchase of U.S. data without warrant, strengthens FISA 2707 requirements, preventing surveillance via private contractors. A U.S. ambassador in Florida arrested for being a double agent; Christian Ziegler, Florida GOP chair, accused of rape and "menage" scandal. CTI League reports a "censorship industrial complex" linking CISA, social media, and academic institutions (Stanford, UW) to pre-bunk narratives and suppress dissent. Cross-agency censorship proposals propose police, military, and intelligence (including Interpol) involvement across Five Eyes. U.S. speech protections, enshrined in First Amendment, are under threat—Mac Thornberry repealed Smith-Munt Act, Nikki Haley opposes anonymous Twitter. Governments in Ireland, Canada, France, EU restrict speech, targeting memes and unshared content. Private platform deplatforming, while not directly violating First Amendment, could breach its spirit under federal pressure.
