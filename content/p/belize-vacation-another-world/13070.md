 Please post something about the corruption in fairhope.
The developers are ruining the city. We are now over 40k peeps if you count just outside the sh*tty limits. Thanks in advance. Sure the real estate folks are getting rich but our town is becoming a crime haven. Transients and low lifes everywhere you look.
