 Boone is slipping. I had heard a lot about him and his "connections" to the election fixers (Kant's dad in law). I guess now without anyone on the inside he has lost all power. I know Ripp is going to win because he already got rid of Kant and now he pulled a fast one and got a black on the council. Ripp is tearing this place apart as we knew it and rebuilding it before our eyes. Can Boone, Burrell and Brown the three amigos overcome 10,000 new voters? What case will they make for re-election? Ripp isn't running for office, just pointing out that they are self serving and corrupt bastards. The good ole boys are in big trouble y'all.
