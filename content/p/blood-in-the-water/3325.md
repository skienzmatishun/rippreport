 The saddest thing, to me, is that the national media is reporting that Strange lost simply because he was aligned with McConnell and that Alabama voters were voting against the Republican establishment; while that may be true to a point, they should also report the facts of how Strange became Senator in the first place.  I think that Roy Moore is a national embarrassment, but I voted for him because I had no other choice if I wanted Strange out.  If more people were aware of what a lying stealing hypocrite Strange was, they would understand why Alabama voted as we did.
