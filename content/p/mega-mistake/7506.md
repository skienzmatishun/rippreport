 Earline, I get sick and tired you of and your ilk using the word "Christian" to justify the actions of greedy men.
As Ghandi once said," I like your Christ but I do not like your Christians."
If this is what being Christian is about then these men have hijacked the Christian religion as well.  According to YOUR interpretation of Christian then Christians are going to Hell.
