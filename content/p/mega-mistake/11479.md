 Lee Lawson should run for a typical Alabama politician because that's basically what he is. A lot of talk and no accountabikity or results - no different than Chris Elliott. 

Baldwin County Economic Alliance exists to pay Lee to talk about stats and travel expense. Lee takes money from local government and federal grants for self benefit with little benefit to the taxpayer. Anyone who had his track record would have been fired or voted out. 

As one of the fastest growing counties in the country, economic development is not a hard job! Our county has much to offer and I believe so much more could have been accomplished if these tax dollars were spent on genuine, accountable economic development.
