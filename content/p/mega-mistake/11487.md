 The mega-site could not find 800 to 1500 employees. It is a fantastic place to live, that should not be the reason to accept the blatant corruption. You are right Tim Kant was so corrupt I decided to become involved with local politics. I am pleased to say The Ripp Report has been very successful on many consumer and corruption issues.
