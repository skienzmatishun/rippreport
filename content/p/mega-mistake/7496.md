 Do not expect them to pass ANY impact fees.   This is Catalystâ€™s main aim:  NO IMPACT FEES.   This political group is funded by developers and put politicians in office to keep any mention of impact fees from even coming up on any agenda
A Catalyst politician will tell you that an impact fee just adds to the price of the house.   This is not true.  An impact fee takes from their profit.   A house will sell at market value and the impact fee takes from their profit
Most of the County Commission, local politicians and judges are owned by Catalyst.  There are three that were vetted by Catalyst and their campaigns paid for by Prebble, Cox, Belaton, DR Horton, Gumbo PAC, Volkert, and the Real Estate PAC
I saw the finance reports.  The politicians have sold themselves and are owned by this group
Cox would like to sue me but the truth keeps him from doing so
