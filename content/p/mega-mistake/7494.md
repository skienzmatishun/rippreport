 What is the biggest problem Baldwin County faces?....it is rampant and uncontrolled growth. So, why did the County Commission want to buy an expensive piece of property to promote industry to create more growth. Stop it Commissioners. The property has been purchased, the good ole boys have made a killing, you now own the property. Itâ€™s highest and best use is to grow pine trees. Plant some pines on the property and move on. Man up and pass an impact fee to slow growth and fund solutions to the many problems the County faces, such as the County wide sewage crisis.
