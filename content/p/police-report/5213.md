 What are they going to discuss? A 13 year-old DISMISSED public intoxication,a harassment aligation, where the "victim" has not press any charges (was probably Rip or Chris) or maybe they can discuss the sealed juvenile cases in which he was a witness and possible witness. 
Where is the BIG record? Where is one conviction? What a joke.
