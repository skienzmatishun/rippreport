A DOCUMENT FOR CATALYST

A police report is a public document, it is not a Ripp Report, it is a police report. The Ripp Report has received several tips involving Mr Jack Burrell and the law. What was alleged was that Mr. Burrell had gotten out of several incidents with the law, by having good connections. They were allegations and I had no evidence to prove other wise. In January of this year it was suggested that I request police report for Jack Burrell in Fairhope. I did so through an attorney in Birmingham.

Those of you new to the Ripp Report may wish to read the link below. You will see where the Airport Authority investigated The Ripp Report and claimed that they had filed an ethics complaint, that had no merit. Your tax dollars paid for Jack Burrell’s legal defense. The paid attorneys were successful in scrubbing the ethics complaint, however it seems new eyes are looking at the facts again.

The Airport Authority has a great idea! They are going to use your tax dollars to hire “ the top ethics attorney in Alabama” to investigate me and The Ripp Report, and attempt to “head off” any…

Fairhope is being held hostage by Burrell and his persistent fight for the Airport Authority to maintain control, and hold the title of the Airport. Burrell is the city liaison to the Airport Authority Board as well as City Council President. Fairhope pays for the mortgage yet cannot claim it as an asset. The title to the Airport should be held by the city, Jack we want our Airport back.

## YOU DON’T KNOW JACK

I have followed four Fairhope city councils and one thing I can tell you is with each new council several things became abundantly clear. The new members of the council are usually influenced by…

Mr Burrell has never disclosed the fact that he has a police record. Just like the Airport, and many other issues, he is lying through his teeth.

The Ripp Report wishes to extend to Mr. Burrell all the space he needs, on the Ripp Report, to explain the charges levied against him by a court of law. Call lagniappe or al.com, the public is interested in you explanation.

The police report is just ONE of the things that has come to light, there is more.

Just thinking out loud “I wonder if Jack’s good friend Judge Michelle Thomason, knows of Jack’s police record?”

The Fairhope City Council was made aware of the police report weeks ago and choose to ignore it.

The council has refused to answer to any accountability, transparency is a black hole and ethics is a fantasy. If you are on the city council in Fairhope then you can act with impunity. Another good example is councilman Robert Brown.

Mr. Jack Burrell should immediately step down from the position of President of the Fairhope City Council, as well as his board position with the Fairhope Airport Authority. These are the actions of a Catalyst mindset, elect Catalyst candidates and you will get more of the same.
