 An arrest for public intox that was dropped. A harassment report where he was listed as a suspect but not charged. A witness to a juvenile case and an other party on a second juvenile case,, meaning mentioned in the report but not the suspect, victim or a witness. While those are interactions with the police, I wouldn’t call that a police record. If you’ve ever filed a report with a law enforcement agency, you would have the equivalent. Been in a car wreck, by that standard, police record. Jack is an anus, but nothing there people. He had no convictions. At least not according to that document.
