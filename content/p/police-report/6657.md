 Poor Chief. He himself and a lot of people thought he was a pretty good person with some respect. What they did to him and how he let Jack and the cheerleaders parade around him I will never understand. I just know that I feel some pity for him but I never thought he was such a stupid person that retired with little or no respect at all. I’ve shook him with many of times. Didn’t know that he was just sorryass Cheif that hopefully showed the rest of the Faihope Police force just how not to retire as just an old pathetic man with nothing to show for except being a fool for Jack and the Kackasses.
