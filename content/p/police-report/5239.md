 What will be interesting to see is if media picks this up. They're always spinning the truth when it comes to nonissues with the mayor but never seem to blink an eye when legitimate newsworthy issues come up. 

Where is the article on ethics concern wirh Brown getting the contract for the art center?  Will there be anything that comes of Burrell police report?  I doubt it. 

All special interests seem to be protected in this town.
