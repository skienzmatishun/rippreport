 What in the world about the letterhead makes you say this is fake?  You are typical of so many people who shout "fake news" each time they are presented with something they don't like or don't agree with.  Jackfan (what a ridiculous name), that is NOT what "fake news" is.  There is zero reason to believe that this police report is not 100% accurate and only a "Jackfan" would claim differently.  I've heard for years that Burrell had police records.  This is simply proof of it.
