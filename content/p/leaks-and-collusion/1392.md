 Remember when I posted the mayor extended the olive branch for a reason, she knew something bad was coming and she was going to need to the council? She ate lunch and dinner with a few council members. 

That was about the time she had the computers 'tapped', this mayor defines the term Dark Triad. 

She could not leave things alone, she had to ruin hard working people lives, so now, the Jester has been unleashed to start dancing!

Those that know Jester, knows Jester's abilities scares even the devil himself. 

Strike fast! Strike hard!





Oh, and while the Queen was looking down
The jester stole her thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
A verdict was returned
