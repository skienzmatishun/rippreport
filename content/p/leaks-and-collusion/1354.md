 One is a blog, and one claims to practice legitimate journalism. Yet they report a standard practice of many organizations, as planting mal-ware. They took a non-story, and twisted it into something that sounds outrageous. They don't do that to Jack. You also have supposedly journalists acting on the same level as a sensationalist blog. Good work!
