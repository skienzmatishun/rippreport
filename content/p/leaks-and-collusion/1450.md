 Mayor Kant left this new mayor with one of the strongest balance sheets of any city in Baldwin County. This current council works their butts off, and they are smart. You should be thankful for Kant's prior leadership, and this council's leadership, this council wants nothing but the best for the city. If this mayor had her way she, she would spend, spend, then spend more, she may even Ripp on the payroll. Even Ripp knows he couldn't work for the lady.
