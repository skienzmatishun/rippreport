 Why the hate? Why the name calling? Where is the hope in Fairhope? Where is the love on Monday? It is a new week, we all start out the week pleasant, right? 

The mayor will have Dean make a bronze statue of herself before she resigns, of course, Dean and, on one knee Ripp beside her! We all can worship these shrine in due time, there has not been enough damage yet, not enough long-term employees fired!

When all the city workers have been replaced with carpetbaggers and unqualified baggers at that, then the mayor will fly a new flag and have the statue raised and placed in the center circle at the peer, that will be your last order! That way when the sky-cam of TV-15-Mobile previews the peer it will reach the maximum audience!

Everyone claim down! The bronze material has already been purchased! 

Strike Fast! Strike Hard!
