 I think that I have read that Lynn is a 'supporter' to whom Karin promised a $60,000/year 'part time job'....Maser is supposed to about 65 years old.....what value could she provide to the city at that salary?
I wish that Karin Wilson would breathe a breath of fresh air and send Botop/Botox/Mosher family/ Lynn Maser to the trash bin.  She has a real chance to help the city that she purports to love, but she has become the worst offender of political power that Fairhope has ever seen.  Kant was more of a thief, but Karin (who I adored until I found out about Twinkle Toes) is even worse.  She disgusts me!  Burrell gave her the rope with which to hang herself when he told her that she could hire her uneducated high school graduate!  We may not like Jack, but we have to hand it to him.........he gave her the rope with which she hangs herself.  The only question now is if Botox will resign to keep Wilson from her fate?
