Nothing has been determined or even a hearing to determine if anything needs to move forward. But, the genius in law that you attempt to show. We guess you already knew that too. If you are on the job. You are responsible for any personal action that you might perform on your business computer. I know my degree trumps yours. Don't do personal business on your business computer.
