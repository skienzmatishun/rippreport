 Karin's campaign platform:
1. Leadership for Responsible Growth (F)
--Leadership is lacking and growth issues still persist with no apparent plan of action. 
2. End Wasteful Spending (D)
--Airport debt was refinanced, but personnel issues and illogical ideas (i.e., take-over of library) overshadow any progress. 
3. Restore Communication and Trust (D)
--Town Hall meetings have been a positive (June meeting scheduled?), but overall communication is disjointed and inconsistent. Hirings and firings have been a disaster. 
4. Protect Our Most Valuable Assets (C)
--Stood firm on Fly Creek issue, well done.

Honestly, doubtful if the grades for any council member, based on their campaign promises, would be any better.
