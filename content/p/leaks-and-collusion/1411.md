 This is exactly why Karin Wilson needs to purge her administration of her overpaid friends and begin acting like she actually gives a flip about Fairhope.  If she doesn't clean it up fast, Burrell will be Mayor and we will have apartments and Section 8 housing everywhere that there is a patch of dirt left. All he cares about is making sure that his buddies can make a quick buck and pass some on to him.  Anyone who has any influence with Wilson should try to talk her into at least pretending to care about our city.
