 I don't have a problem with her firing Sullivan and Fidler or anyone else.  My problem is with the incompetent  and uneducated new hires and their absurd salaries. They will be Wilson's downfall, not Sullivan &amp; Fidler.  They may have been incompetent &amp; uneducated, as well (I have no idea), but if you throw out dirty water you buy clean water to replace it; she threw out dirty water and then paid more  taxpayer money to purchase more dirty water.  If she wants to hire her friends, she should put them to work at Page &amp; Pallette; the city does not need to support these people.
