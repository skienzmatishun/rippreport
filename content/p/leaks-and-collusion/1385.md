 I have lived in Fairhope about ten years. I am not from Alabama. I am one of those yankee jerks.  During that time I have watched Paul Ripp go after Kant. He never stopped.  He got Tim Kant.  He got him good when nobody said he could.   Kant was rigging the elections. Not no more.
Paul Ripp is a Marine and a trained sniper.  I doubt if he is intimidated by Jack and his redneck buddies with money.  These guys aren't tough.
My point here is short:
Ripp is going to get rid of all of the trash on the council in the next election and he may be able to get one or two to resign before. Kant's uncle is in retirement. No more rigging.
Ripp is the last man standing and he knows way more than any council man. These new guys on the council are in big trouble. Wait till Ripp turns his crosshairs on them.

Ripp is Fairhope's only hope to rid itselves from the pariah of corruption the good ole boys have brought home. God bless Paul Ripp. Where I come from he is a real man.
