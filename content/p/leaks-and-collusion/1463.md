 What? Are you Kant's lover or child or something. Geeze. I know the turth might sting a little. But it's certainly been proven that Kant has done many things to prove he is a crook. If you had been coming to the meetings all these years. It would have been proven right before your eyes. He has never done whats best for the MAJORITY of the citizens of Fairhope. I'm  standing by my statement about the 3 amigos. No positive remarks were given about anyone and the New Mayor wasn't brought up.  Still trying to figure all this crap out, wrong or right, regarding the new Mayor. If it's proven that she is guilty. I'll have even jump on your side. You've done a pretty good job running your own mouth about how You know Kant isn't a crook without proof but that the New Mayor terrible.  You would bring up hateful comments about the New Mayor if we were discussing the weather.  Get over it. Let the legal system do its job and come to a meeting sometime. You prove she is guilty. "Strike Fast! Strike Hard!  Are you reading this while being on the video game that you've been playing all this time since the election.
