 The reason the mayor loves carpetbaggers is they are the only people that believe her Bull Poop. Those of us that grew up around here and know her, knew better than to vote for her! 

I guess when you only have superficial friends, and you have this great need to be adored, then when you become mayor you give people jobs so you keep friends. Kant, he gave his family and friends that grew up in Fairhope jobs, not a bunch of loud mouth rude, slimy carpetbaggers, he took care of Fairhope! 

Toto could resign tomorrow and that will not save the mayor, she is done. It is clear that those not from around here still do not understand how this works, you carpetbaggers just do not get it. 

We all grew up around here, we are related to many, and those that we are related to are related through marriage to others, we go to church together, we have known each other all of our lives. And when someone harms hard working people from around here then all hell breaks loose.

While the mayor was born and raised here, she made herself an outsider. She never volunteered for the city, she doesn't worship, all she has ever done is take from the city. Her friends are all superficial friends. 

This mayor is over, done, it is over for her!
