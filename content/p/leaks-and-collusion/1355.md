 Did she try to create a position and hire her friend Lynn M. or not?  Just tell us, instead of questioning the motives of those who made that PUBLIC --not anonymous--claim.  Why keep your denial a secret?

The last refuge of the guilty:  don't deny the allegations but try to change the subject by blaming the people who revealed the behavior. (See:  Hillary's leaked emails, Trump aides' leaked contacts with the Russians, Mayor Wilson's treatment of HR Director and surreptitious spying on employees.)  

Could anyone blame the Mayor's accusers of wanting to remain anonymous, given her record of viciously retaliating against anyone who dares speak against her?  She will have her day in court. But if she is not willing to respond to these allegations, she (and her surrogates, like you,Paul) should keep your mouths shut about those who make them.

Oh, and what happened to transparency? When she was elected, I gave the Mayor a lot of credit for insisting that all meetings be recorded.  But now that these HR questions have surfaced, she cancelled the June 15th public HR meeting unilaterally, without first consulting other members of the committee.
