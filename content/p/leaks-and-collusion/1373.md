 4.7 of this year or last year or last month or the last 5 years were carpetbaggers like you prefer to call them. What are you trying to say besides you just want to run your mouth. I guess you are saying that you and the other 95.3 percent are GOB dumbasses. That's a clear fact. Thanks for the figures. I guess? Not sure what point you are trying to make. We just want people to keep their promises and treat the citizens of Fairhope and Baldwin County with respect. Its been proven that the Fairhope council cannot do it and the Baldwin County Commission darn sure can't do it. Facts. Can't argue with the facts.
