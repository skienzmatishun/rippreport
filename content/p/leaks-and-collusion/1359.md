 Fairhope at its finest! 

Did anyone see the picture of the mayor and Jimmy Cluster? 

Here's the mayor statement about Cluster "I was honored to present long-term city employee, Jimmy Cluster, a plaque of appreciation for his retirement commending thirty years of unselfish, dedicated service to the City of Fairhope."

I told this is how Fairhope works, they will hug you, say oh, it is so good to see you, then state how much they hate the person they just hugged. 

Let's see how many people will stand next to the mayor, that picture on facebook of her winning the election, how many of those in the picture will be standing by her now!

Kant was dirty, and he was slick but at least he was not as dumb as this mayor!
