Fairhope City Hall has leaks of confidential city information and HR information coming from certain city employees to Gulf Coast News. Congratulations on the news scoop, however your information is coming from unnamed sources or disgruntled employees.

{{< socialpreview url="https://www.gulfcoastnewstoday.com/the-courier/stories/tracking-software-installed-on-7-fairhope-employees-computers,50355" >}}

These are city computers and if these same computers were used to undermine the mayor on the city’s time and our dime, then they should be fired. If the same computers transmitted confidential city business to unauthorized persons then there should be some accountability.

Spyware is common and used in private and government sectors. The bottom line is that it is city property and the data contained.

Gulf Coast News coverage is lacking in details and soaring with innuendo. The articles all seem to be coordinated to come out at one time and certainly favor the old established status quo, GOB’s.

How much you want to bet that pornography and computer games were on certain computers? It always happens. If indeed the spyware exists then there is no telling what is on them other than city business. If the employee is using the city computers for personal business then how in the hell is it the city’s responsibility to protect your personal info? When the employee has no authority from the city to use the computer for personal use? You can watch all the porn you want and play those silly games until you are blue, AT HOME, not on the job, any job. They are going to hang themselves, watch!

The HR director, one in the same seeking 100,000 dollars for alleged assault has been observed playing games on her computer at numerous city meetings. Gotta watch throwing stones in a glass house.

The coverage by Gulf Coast News, The Courier, is being influence by the likes of Catalyst and Jack Burrell, certain lawyers and judges as well as supported by county commissioners. Fairhope has been controlled by the GOB’s for over 40 years they are in panic mode. If they lose Fairhope they lose the county commission and the mid term elections will result in many elected officials defeated.

Most residents of Fairhope are viewed by the GOB’s as outsiders, not from here, or carpetbaggers, if we dare to question the old guard. The fact is that over 75% of the population has moved here, in the last 30 years, from “other” places, and it will be them who eventually wins out over the GOB mentality.

What irony that GOB’s own greed and corruption for unbridled development produced residents, that will now vote them out of office!
