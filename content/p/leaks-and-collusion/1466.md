 The big fans of transparency over at the Gulf Coast Media edited their manipulative and defamatory description of SentryPC as "Malware" but forgot to apologize or make any mention their error and any damage it may have caused SentryPC. If they had any journalistic integrity, they would. After all, nothing goes away on the Internet. Why try to hide it?
