 Ripp didn't get Kant, Kant got himself, Kant was his own worst enemy. Kant became a politician instead of a public servant, he stopped listening to his department heads, and then he became hostage to the money brokers. 

The election wasn't about who was better, both were poor choices, it was a fresh start. A start that has not happened, a start that is just like Kant's. Hiring his friends, hiring those that are not qualified. This new mayor has harmed hard working people, people that may have disagreed with her, so she, like Kant thinks she owns the city. The public has lost total confidence in the mayor. Walk about town, a just listen! 

If you think really qualified people will come and work for the city, think again, especially with this spyware issue, who would want to work in that environment? If you have a disagreement with the mayor, you could be subject to being spied on! This mayor has used the playbook from a dictator! 
 
Ripp is a Marine, he knows who the real deal is!   

Strike Fast! Strike Hard!
