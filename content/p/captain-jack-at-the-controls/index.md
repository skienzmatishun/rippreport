The Fairhope Airport Authority, under control of Fairhope Council President Jack Burrell, continues to raise eyebrows,”What the hell is really going on at the Airport.” Millions of development dollars from federal agencies have expanded the airport with additional runways. Hangers are being offered on long term leases and no specific long range plan has been presented to the public.

You just may look up one day and see Southwest flying in, think about it!

Some strongly feel that the Airport Authority needs a face lift, like taking Captain Jack’s face out of the Authority all together. As President of the Council and liaison for the council to the Authority, Mr Burrell has done everything possible to maintain control of the Airport Authority and isolate the City from any participation. The Authority is subsidized by the City of Fairhope, yet the Authority refuses to allow the City to gain title to the Airport.

The Airport Authority, piloted by Captain Jack is again playing games when it comes to leases of hangers at the Airport. The Authority Board President Joe McEnerney, was soundly reminded by Captain Jack that he is at the controls.

After the defeat of former Fairhope Mayor Can’t, in 2016, documents were presented to the Ripp Report pertaining to leases of hangers at the Airport and the suspicious nature in which the bids were handled. Captain Jack was getting free air miles and golf vacations from a board member while overseeing the bid process for the same board member.

Of course their was no accountability because Captain Jack was at the controls.

NO ACCOUNTABILITY NO TRANSPARENCY Please read the documents and you will see why the Ripp Report still has it’s 5000.00 dollars

The Authority receives 7cents on the dollar as a fuel income, from lease holders. Here is the kicker, no one has any record of what is being used. Some board members say the fuel used is a personal business and the board has no right to that information. The Fixed Based Operator does not share his info on gallons consumed, with the Authority. So how do you pay your bill? Do you just send the Authority

a check for gallons used, without any record. Ask the Captain Jack just how he collects the 7 cents?

Also ask him to explain the Police Report that he never revealed during the last election.
