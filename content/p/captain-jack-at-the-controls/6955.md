 Have heard sex trafficking happening at the airport for some time. May be a rumor but it's suspect when two board members appointed by "Can't" will do anything to stay even though their terms have expired! Why?  It's a volunteer position! Council blocked Mayor Wilson's efforts to appoint new people too. It just doesn't add up.
