 Judas,
Be an adult about this.  If the topic is that the airport is being paid for by the city yet the city has no control over it, then start and end there.  Making childish remarks about what is NOT going on at the airport is distracting from the issue at hand.  
I may disagree with how the airport is being run and paid for, but I also know that making stupid remarks only degrades the point that Ripp is trying to make.
