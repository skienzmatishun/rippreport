 Hey Mr. Ripp! Remember that time you got the AL Secretery of State to come down to Fairhope and oversee the municipal election? It ended up Kant lost and Karin Wilson was elected! Them was good times! Things ain't the same, you know!  Hey you gonna oversee the election again this time or do you think Kant and his relatives will git back to stealing?
Asking for a dear friend.

Gonna hang up Paul and listen.
