 He would lose. He's a public figure. Read up on it. See, when Ripp wins a lawsuit it means he is right according to the law. When Jack loses, and he did lose, it means he broke the law and was in the wrong. That's how it works and you people calling his lawsuits frivolous should look up what that means as it doesn't apply to lawsuits that are won.
