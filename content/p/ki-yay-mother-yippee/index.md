Bruce Willis, the Star of the greatest Christmas Movie of all times: DIE HARD has Aphasia. We have have a crime problem in Alabama that begins and ends with the Ethics Laws and those who wrote them, but also those who enforce (and it's kind of a joke) as is the 3 percent of the Alabama General Fund Budget allocated to the Court System.

Governor turned mega-lobbyist Steve Windom, one third owner of said software firm; and his bride Presiding Judge of the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals Mary Edna Windom (R-Mobile).

And Governor Ivey now says the election was stolen from former President Donald Trump. The Muscogee Creeks from Oklahoma make a trip to their ancestral homeland in Alabama this week.

Yes, it almost happened again. And "The Trafficker" from Florida takes some shots at the Sec Def.
