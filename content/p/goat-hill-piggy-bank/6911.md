 Seriously, Robert Brown is a partner in a well respected home building company.....I don't know what city contract you refer to (probably the art center), but that is absurd.  His company has been making money for years and he can probably afford to buy whatever he wants.  Additionally, I have heard that the art center was not even his project, but it was Cliff Pitman's.  Do you think that he stole something also?
