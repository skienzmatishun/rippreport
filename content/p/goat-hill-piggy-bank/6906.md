 Ran. You must not be from around here. Baldwin County has contributed an average of OVER 30% of the entire Alabama States budget for the past 30 years that I personally know for a fact. No other County in Alabama even comes close. So think about all the money these goofy, lying pieces of crap are wasting each and everyday. Waste includes funding their own agenda as well as the kickbacks they receive. It’s amazing how many of these politicians that I walked up to when we had the dedication at Orange Beach that would just simply lie straight to your face. You find me a politician in the State of Alabama that hasn’t lied or personally benefited their own bank accounts with unlawful monies and I’ll show you Santa Claus and bring the Easter Bunny to your house. These sobs don’t even know that God is watching and judging them. They must think they are invisible to the Lord. Damn them all!
