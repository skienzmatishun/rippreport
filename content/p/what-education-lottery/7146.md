 Baldwin Politicians and church..... 
Ol’ Joe F. hands out peppermints in church. 

I always figured it masked his breath. 

I’m really glad they all go to church because they need it!! If I were them, I would be consumed by guilt. 

I am sure they find a way to sleep at night as they justify how they treat others. Maybe giving out peppermints is penance. 

Thought the voters would have been smarter and replaced him and Chris last election. 
Now they have their very own PR man they are paying with OUR TAX DOLLARS. Chuckee Cheese is in Montgomery as we speak. That sickens me.
