 So what does the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission?) have to do with this site?   If you are going to report this site then report it to CNN and say Ripp hates Trump.  It really doesn't matter if Ripp loves or hates Trump - just say Ripp hates Trump.
Then CNN will be down here to cover this story quicker than a Catalyst politician allowing a new subdivision to be built and making the existing county people to pay for the infrastructure.
