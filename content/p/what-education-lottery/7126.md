 Hey “OkwithKaye”. I am having to do something about it. Me and my family are working very hard to make Alabama a better place to live and have done so with many generations. Where the F are you from because at the same time we are having to put up sorryass people like you everyday. Really doesn’t matter where you are from. I know why you like Kaye. I guess y’all are on first name basis. I see her every month and I can tell you just how out of touch the goofball we have for Governor is. Creepy if you want to know the truth. It’s KAY by the way.  Where are you from   I would have to agree with the the post on how stupid you people are if you don’t even know how to spell our own Governor’s name.  Dating the Governor?  Alabama is not even one 100th of Great you say it is “okwithkaye”. We certainly have the bar set a lot higher than you do. Close your mouth and put your shoes back back and get the ripple out. You certainly are not educated!!!
