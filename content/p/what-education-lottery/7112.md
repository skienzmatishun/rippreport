 Yall are so busy working and paying TAXES you don't realize what's happpening...and the media ain't gonna show you...the politicians are gonna build three bridges across the intracoastal and then build massive residential development on the traversing side. Get ready beaches...you guys are gonna get slammed with traffic. The people in power see money in lower Baldwin. The writing is on the wall.
