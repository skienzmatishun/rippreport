 Let’s not forget  about all the sorry ass people that work for or with or supports Chris Elliott. Plenty of garbage out of office and in office that supports anything to do with Chris Elliott!  All of  you Baldwin County School Teachers that were too stupid to see what a scumbag and terrible supporter of education that this Chris Elliott is and HAS always been. To think of any Lottery bill for the State of Alabama that INCLUDES the Porch Creek Indians benefiting from it and EXCLUDES Education from it is just about all I can stand. Wake up all you barefooted dumbass Alabama people who can’t see that this is money in all their pockets to spend down the road on raising their own salaries and screwing Education once again. Damn Alabama is just plain Stupid!!! Elliott, man you must get off every time you screw us because you do it WELL AND YOU DO IT OFTEN!!!
