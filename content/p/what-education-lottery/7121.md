 Well Ripp. I guess we can see that many things we have known are really true. One thing for certain. We people of Alabama have a Governor who doesn’t have an ounce of leadership blood in her body and even less than that of brains in her head. What a disgrace we are. I have always put bowed my head down when any of the National Media is doing a story in the State of Alabama and everyone in this State know exactly what I’m talking about. They always pick an individual with the lowest income, the fewest teeth and 9 out of 10 times, no shoes or shirt and probably smoking a cigarette while being interviewed. Well, that’s exactly what ever single politician in Alabam represents because none of them do anything about other politicians that screw us everyday. We have so many politicians that take credit for things that they could have not done without Trump but at the same time. Trump would have accomplished what they did and more without them. Let me repeat. Non of you in any of an elected position are doing a good job by allowing the corruption that is taking place across the state of Alabama from the bottom to the top. Keep dreaming that you all are. You don’t have us fooled. You are only fooling yourselves.
