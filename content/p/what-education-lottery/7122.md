 Alabama is also ranked 3rd worst state for poverty.  Alabama's unemployment rank is 3%. Which you are being a little generous in that statement. It's 3.7%.  Still not a bad rank, but if the unemployment is so low and the poverty is also ranked as 3rd worst state, how exactly do you think that is a good thing?  People are working and they are still poor.  Wow, thanks.
