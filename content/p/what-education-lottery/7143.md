 Jackfan2020, Ripp would have already been sued if he was being inaccurate.  It seems as if it is getting harder and harder for you to carry the water of Jack who thinks he is a god and above reproach.  This article is only the first and LEAST of your worries.  More and more is getting out about these "Christian" hypocrites.  I used to attend the Methodist Church until I saw Jack stand at the lectern and address the congregation.
I now go to another church where the Catalyst hypocrites have not yet infiltrated.  They have let Satan take over the Episcopalian and Methodist Churches in Fairhope.
