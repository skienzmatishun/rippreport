 So Fairhope is at the proverbial cross road. Which way will it go? I say it is too late and it will soon be a crime-infested haven for low rent losers from Bham and Montgomery. The eastern shore has been invaded. It is incredible. The number of shady cars driving around is scary to say the least. I just want us to be Mayberry again! It's scary. I never thought of Fairhope as a big city but that's what we are now. So much hassle. I want to go back!
