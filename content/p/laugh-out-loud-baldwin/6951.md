 Off subject for just a second. If some of these jets and planes continue to fly below the restricted altitude. I’ll show you how to shut down the Airport and Jack Burrell. I don’t care how many fly over. Obey the FFA laws. Don’t think that I’m just another bullshiter like Kack Burrel is!  One last thing. I hope that the next time someone in Faihope says that we are not in the education business. They too will have their sorry ass pointed out of our town. This is our town. Stand up people!
