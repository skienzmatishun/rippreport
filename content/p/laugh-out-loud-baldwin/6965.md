 I have put my home on the bay for sale. Tired of seeing garbage and human waste on the shore. It happens too much now. We haven't fished in over ten years. Even if we caught something we couldn't eat it. I hope Fairhope folks are happy with what you created. 15 years ago Fairhope  when I moved here was nice and sweet. Now it is a nightmare. Keep telling everybody that it's great in fairhope. Then do like me and put up a sign. Before we are stuck. God help politicians like the catalyst gang who put their own interests above that of the people. I see big problems ahead. Does anybody else see it? Meanwhile I am planning to move to TX. The new thing is planned towns and cities like Frisco maybe...good luck with the Christian politicians who lie to your  face. Get rid of that fat baldheaded lying loser Chris Elliot! He campaigned at church only to lie straight to everyone's face.
