 But wait DUI Elliot just passed a bill that forces developers to go before the school board to get their neighborhoods passed.

Think how unrealistic this is. This is just feelgood stuff to make you forget he fleeced your wallet at tax time.

I hope Northcutt runs again. He will win.

Elliott (Kojak) may have a slick head but his butt is dead.
He will not be relected.
