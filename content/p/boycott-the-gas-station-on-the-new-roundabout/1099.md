 Fairhope has major infrastructure concerns.  I have watched for years the city fail to reinvest in water, electric and roads, not to mention the sewer plant, which I consider a health concern given the alternatives to discharging into the bay.

The discharge pipe should be removed and a new plant should be built. This is a refusal by the past mayor and two council members to do the right thing.  They prolonged the problem by throwing money at the current antiquated locale.

While traffic concerns are real as commute times increase heading north and south on 98, most don't know that our lift stations that push sewerage through our hilly system--do not possess generators.  This is a real threat in hurricane situations where we lose power for days.

This problem has existed for more than a decade. The council and mayor have done nothing.

The fire station on a dead end road was a huge piece of infrastructure for Mr. Corte's apartment complex (planned) and neighborhood. It was not for city safety--after all it is on a dead end road.
