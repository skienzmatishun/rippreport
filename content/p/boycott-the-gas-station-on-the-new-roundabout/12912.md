 I for one am wondering what the breaking point is for Fairhope folks. We have  seen the wholesale theft of our town by developers. Traffic stinks. Riff raff everywhere you look. Subdivisions going up all over. Overcrowding reported by teachers. The big blue wave is coming to fairhope. Thanks Jack.
