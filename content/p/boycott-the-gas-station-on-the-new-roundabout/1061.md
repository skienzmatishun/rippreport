 Because boycotts have proved so effective any time we don't get our way.  This is a GREAT idea!  I'm not sure this is a national embarrassment, either.  Heck, the people in our own county probably aren't as worked up as some might think. Here's one in Washington State and I think I see two gas stations in the picture.  Doubly nationally embarrassed I guess.
