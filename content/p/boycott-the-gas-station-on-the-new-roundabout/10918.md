 I stay away from McSharry’s because I don’t look for trouble and I know in some cases trouble would come looking for me.
If you had a few drinks at any bar and try to drive home, yuh can bet that if a police officer stopped you, you would blow more than .08.    If one has a commercial driver license, you must blow 0.0
So how does one drive after a few drinks from any bar?
