 I doubt that she 'assaulted' anyone…….sour grapes all over here! Heathcoe is being demoted and was clearly the target of Karin Wilson's (unwarranted) wrath, but this is not an indictable offense. If it were, we would have been aware of it almost 6 years ago.  Lots of sour grapes from uneducated and overpaid City employees who have been put in their proper places since the last election.  Clearly, Wilson was out of line if she even touched Pandora, but the fact that Jennifer Fidler is the witness tells the story.   Just because someone was 'close to' Mayor Kant does not entitle one to 'special salaries/priviliges'.  Yes, these ladies miss Kant!
