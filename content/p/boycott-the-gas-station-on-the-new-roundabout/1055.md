 Well, that figures. A transplant complaining about too many people here. And you want to bring up the fire station situation? The land was donated do the department for the specific use of the station. It was needed for the North End of the city to satisfy ISO requirements, thus keeping the insurance rates low for the citizens. It was all roses till some pretentious transplant renting a house nearby started complaining about the possible noise, demanding that the fire department not use Sirens or horns. Its always "not in my backyard" with this guy. Must be a horrible way to live being miserable all the time.
