 You people that moved in to one of the cookie cutter subdivisions built by Truland or DR Horton just need to charter your own schools.   Please do not burden us with your infrastructure needs
You move in like a swarm of locusts and wonder why the roads, sewers, water, schools, and services are overtaxed
You blue state refugees are a pain in the neck.  You moved from a state that God blessed and you messed it up.  Now you you come here and want to mess us up.    
We know your game.   Either learn manners or go back to the hell hole that you fled
BOOM.   Insert mic drop here
