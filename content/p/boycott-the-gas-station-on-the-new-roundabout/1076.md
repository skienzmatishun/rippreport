 Everyone knows what I love about this blog? The owner does not live inside the city limits of Fairhope but he knows everything there is to know, just ask him. 

All you have to do is ask for your property to be annexed just like the good ole girl mayor wants! Annex into the city then you can bitch, like I tell everyone if you don't vote you can not bitch! You're not eligible to vote!

The reason you don't want your property to be annexed is you'll have to clean up that hell hole and start paying 2% in property tax. 

You take up time in from the council that is reserved for citizens, you are not even a citizen!

The citizens want this, the citizens want that, how the hell do you know? You are not even a citizen and you supported a mayor that assaulted a long-term employee but yet you could not even vote for her!

You know what is called someone that is an outsider like you, a propagandist! The only reason you care about those apartments is you think the traffic will be too much on your street. There is a business on your property that doesn't have a license from the city, and your sign doesn't meet the ordinances of the city sign laws! 

Oh, Boone and Burrel do this, oh, Burrel and Boone do that, why don't you start paying your fair share of taxes and obey the laws like the rest of us? Huh??????
