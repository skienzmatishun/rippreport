 I called when started clearing to ask what was &amp; found out stupid convenience store - I called County &amp; they blamed on City &amp; called City &amp; they blamed on County - also close to Intermediate School - do you have to be a certain distance away from schools to sell alcohol??  Also emailed Kevin Boone about it - his City Council email (where he wants to represent the citizens of Fairhope)  which is a joke in itself - This was emailed before the election &amp; to this day he still has not responded to me.  He is out there only for himself - plain &amp; simple - He does NOT listen to the residents of Fairhope.  He will not respond to emails from the citizens of Fairhope.  Do not  believe what he says - it is an act - he may go to church but it is totally for show!
