 Oooooh! Sounds like Dumb Azz might have had something to do with the gas station on the round about. Go get your Dr. Pepper and your snickers at one of the several stations already in the area and chill. Get Jack Burrell one too for helping make the "round about" come true. Like you said. "Guess we will just need to get over it". Another broken promise by so many of our Fairhope council members?
