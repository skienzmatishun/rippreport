Some people new to Baldwin County politics want to know what the hell is CATALYST. CATALYST was the name of the good ole boys until it became so toxic, that they recently changed their name to Scott Boone Consulting. This is the same individual that was running CATALYST, they are just hiding under another name, the smell is the same.

CATALYST/Scott Boone Consulting is financed by developers, land owners and any other group profiting by the unbridled development. They are against regulations, impact fees, infrastructure needs, and spend little on our schools.

Good ole Boys refers to the click of CATALYST/ Scott Boone, individuals, that feel entitled to inside deals. Good ole boys, do not recognize any conflicts of interest, ethics, transparency or accountability or have any problem using inside information to secure municipal or public contracts, while serving in elected office. CATALYST hides behind Christianity adding to their hypocrisy.

CATALYST CANDIDATES are running in Spanish Fort, Daphne, Fairhope and Bay Minette. You can help stop the political corruption by not voting for anyone under the CATALYST/Scott Boone banner.

Another way to describe CATALYST/Scott Boone Consulting is a modified version describing defendants in the Strawman land fraud series in Lagniappe.

CATALYST named and unnamed individuals, ”form an integral part of an intricate web of multiple concentric layers of companies, or LLC’s, that are intermingled around and intended, among other things, to conceal the interrelationships among and between, and to insulate from liability, the principal actors who have ultimately owned, controlled, managed or directed the operations and financial transactions of these defendants and non- defendants.”

Read the Strawman series and focus in on the spider web graph. You want to know who is CATALYST and just how corrupt they are ? Read it and take note of the players, Scott Boone and his father, Fairhope councilman Kevin Boone. Strawman is land fraud, and CATALYST/Scott Boone have their fingerprints all over it along with Baldwin County sewer and past County Commissioner Tucker Dorsey. This Lagniappe series exposes just a small segment of corruption that is eating away at Baldwin County resources, for the benefit of a few.

CATALYST associates operate very similar to a criminal enterprise.

The FBI defines a criminal enterprise as “a group of individuals with an identified hierarchy, or comparable structure, engaged in significant criminal activity.” STRAWMAN
