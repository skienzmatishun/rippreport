 Some of the problems I have is why do we as taxpayers pay govt elected people 40,000 to 50,000 for only working 40 days in Montgomery. Why have we not dealt with prisons? Because taxpayers will give money for education not prison. Well, unless taxpayers wants to release alot of inmates money is needed. Being a Officer in prison is very dangerous with no help down the hall. Wardens dont care just want their money. Money must be hear marked for prisons. Why is people putting on the parole board friends of friends. Changes are needed. Roads is Baldwin County need to be address!!! We need Officials who will make the changes that are positive and good for our area.
