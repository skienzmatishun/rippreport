 The traffic is caused by out of control growth.  The out of control growth is because the builders make more profit when they build
They make more profit because they don’t have to fund the infrastructure.  Even when Diamondhead built Lake Forest they had to build a sewer plant     But today’s developers don’t need to do anything to build out the infrastructure because they put into office candidates that will make the residents pay for the growth.  We the same residents that have previously paid for our infrastructure.   
Catalysts steal from Baldwin County’s people.   In another state this bunch would be in prison for racketeering, conspiracy, corruption and theft under the RICO statute
