 If Catalyst/SBC wants Elliot to remain on the State Senate then he will be re-elected.   Do NOT ever buck the machine.   This is Catalyst Country and you are just in it.   Remember this and things will make better sense to all of you in Baldwin County.   No go to work at your second job so you can make mortgage payments on this cheaply built and overpriced houses you all bought for Belaton, DR Horton, and Truland.
