 Ripp is trying to be positive. We have to start somewhere. Getting rid of Elliott would be a good start. He is not a conservative and hardly a Christian as far as I can tell. But why is that the standard? How about if he votes well and looks out for people in his district? We need someone who will fight for Baldwin County and the Eastern Shore. Our traffic problems are going to need funding soon. We are getting locked into a bad situation on the eastern shore I'm afraid and we're gonna need to widen 98 or we will be waiting all the time in traffic. The new homes and apartments are going up left and right.
