 Yep.  Guess who can mass produce those signs?  Catalyst signs are all 4 by 4 signs on a PVC frame.  Take two reinforcement spikes about three feet in length, hammer them four feet apart and a foot into the ground where two feet will be sticking up, and drop the PVC frame down on the spikes.  Repeat these steps on roadways, any White-Spunner property that is listed to them, any real estate company property, and Catalyst member property until the landscape is dotted with 4X4 signs.  Have a few thugs who do not "officially" work for Catalyst to go around and vandalize the opponents' signs and soon you will see a wasteland of Catalyst-vetted political signs.
