 Steve,
You are living in a pipe dream.  These local politicians from the council to the commission to the state legislators do not really care about Baldwin County.
They see lots of money to be made and se that the majority of the voters lean to the right and go to church.   So the political cabal a.k.a. Catalyst or Elliott, Haygood &amp; Stacy and now SBC vet out local people who will do the bidding of the cabal.  Then the Cabal will fit them out with signs, political ads, get them to meets with the real estate developers, manipulate voting laws and, VIOLA!  They win!
This is not just Scott Boone - hell, Scott is not that smart.  It is people like Cox who pulls the strings.  Then Cox's politicians win, the developers get a free reign to do whatever they want.  
Want to put in  another 100 houses? No problem!  Need a road four-laned?  Just raise the citizens' taxes!  Need billions of dollars to get another bridge over Mobile Bay and the federal government won't fit the whole bill?  Just get Elliott to sneak in a toll.
This is how the cabal works.  We MUST awaken the people to make them aware they are being treated like sheep.  But the people are too busy working to pay for the higher cost of living in Baldwin County due to the excessive growth.
