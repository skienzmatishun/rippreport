 Dear 54 Chevy,
Catalyst is not all to blame.  The voters who could not see through the hypocrite politicians that were owned by Catalyst are to blame.
So many people have moved in here that have no ties to Baldwin County so they will vote for whoever they see on a road sign. 
Heck, if Catalyst cannot vet a politician, they will import them.  Just look at one of the county commissioners, Joe Davis, who came from Thomasville.  They lured that person here with a bottle of booze and an elected office. 
Remember he quit the resigned from Daphne City Council because he could not get his pet office building built to the east of Daphne High School?
Well, Catalyst sobered him up, ran him for the county, and viola! He won.  All because the voters bought into the Christian conservative line...
