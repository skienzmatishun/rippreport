 Ok I will pick the mic back up.    Herd immunity
Or you can get Fauci to go to work and do his job and stop pimping for the cameras
He has been wrong since January.   Fauci either needs to go back in the lab and do his job or shut up.  He wants an eternal lockdown.  Even he said he knows nothing about economics
Herd immunity is the element that liberals want to keep out of the conversation 
Don’t tell me anything unless you address herd immunity.  If you cannot address herd immunity then you are using covid to advance tyranny.  
I drop the mic again.  Don’t make me pick it back up again unless you address herd immunity
BOOM
