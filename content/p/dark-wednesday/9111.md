 Keep the mic on the stand, butterfingers.  New York City's reporting 27%.  Herd immunity is about p.  So, after all that has already happened there, the deaths would have to more than double to reach herd immunity.  If they went that route from the beginning, there's no way that the health care system could have managed that many people at once.  Sweden is reporting 7%.  So they are looking at 10x more deaths, infections, etc. to reach herd immunity.
