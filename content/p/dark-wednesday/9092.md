 Some interesting observations about Andy Sather, who is commenting on this Facebook post. He joined Facebook in 2018.  He has no friends.  You can't find him on Google.  If you do an image search for his profile background, you'll see you can only find that picture on a bunch of similar Facebook profiles and other social media. A lot of them are Russian accounts.  He lists no job, "self employed".  Interesting, huh?
