 We should refuse to bail out states by their federal funding to the federal taxes collected. I say, the bottom 10.  New Mexico, West Virginia, Alabama, Mississippi, Vermont, Kentucky, Montana, Alaska and Arksansas. It sucks the tax payers in the top 10, Connecticut, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Illinois, Kansas, New York, North Dakota and Nebraska have to constantly bail out those deadbeats.
