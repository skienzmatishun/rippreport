 Swedenâ€™s per capita death rate was 36 per 100,000, which is higher than the United States at 27 and neighboring Denmark at 9.  You forgot Brazil, second only to the US. States like New York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey, which are among the top 10 states with the highest number of COVID-19 cases, have thousands of unaccounted for excess deaths each. And the US is still behind on testing per capita.  New Zealand, Australia, South Korea have effectively kept the numbers down by properly testing early on.
