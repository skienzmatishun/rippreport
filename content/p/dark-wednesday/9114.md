 YeH, letâ€™s lock up the economy indefinitely.  Never mind suicides, drug abuse, alcoholism, bankruptcies, evictions, the collapse of society, and the trashing of our Constitutional rights because we are saving lives.
The politicians keep getting their  paychecks.
Let the sick quarantine themselves and let the people work.
