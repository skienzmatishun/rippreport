TOP 10 QUESTIONS for Sherry Sullivan and the general public.

By now you all have heard these weak knee interviews of soft ball questions from Fairhope candidates running for office. In Fairhope we have a fired employee who sued the city, running for Mayor, for all the wrong reasons.

Sherry Sullivan who worked under Mayor Cant for almost 16 years. Cant lost and Sherry was fired, as a result of that CATALYST was born. A political group of good ole boys who have brazening labeled themselves and are supported by developers and the profiteers that follow.

Sherry and the 3 B’s are CATALYST/Scott Boone Consulting candidates, financed by the very people degrading our quality of life, property values and schools.

## THESE QUESTIONS ARE REAL, THIS HAPPENED:

Can Sherry Sullivan answer the first 10 questions honestly?

I bet not.

You as voters of FAIRHOPE should at least know the questions.

1\. If you were elected Mayor and you found out you had three employees colluding with one another to obstruct your efforts as Mayor — what would you do?

2\. What would you do if you had 3 employees that had taken city documents, without authority, and then shared the same documents with your political rivals and tabloid press?

3\. What would you do if, as Mayor, you found out the City Attorney and at least 3 City Council members were colluding with one another on ways to make you look incompetent or corrupt?

4\. What would you do if a citizen of the community was assaulted, on video, and the appointed Municipal Judge and City Attorney, repeatedly dropped the ball until the assault charge disappeared?

5\. What would you do if, as Mayor you knew a council person used their office for personal gain?

6\. What would you do if you were made aware of a council person voting on issues where the same council person had interests in those issues he voted on, that were hidden in multiple LLC’s, unknown by the general public?

7\. What would you do if a council person had a police record that had not been disclosed before the council person was elected?

8\. What would you do if 3 members of the council spent **$2,650,000** on recreation land without having a dime for improvements and then they leased the land for **$9,000** a year?

9\. What would you do, as Mayor, if a State Senator came to you to obtain a BP contract and municipal contracts that personally and financially benefited the elected State Senator?

10\. What would you do with the Triangle property? Do you favor a conservation easement?

If you made it this far then educate yourself on what has been going on in Fairhope the last 4 years. Pick out any question and ask Sherry, she will explain.
