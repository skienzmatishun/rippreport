The Mayor of Fairhope is cutting the city budget to compensate for the anticipated loss of municipal income due to COVD-19.

The staff, police, fire and other cuts came up to 2.6 million.

Does that figure sound familiar?

It is the same price for the recreation land that councilman Burrell Boone and Burrell, the three Bâ€™s, insisted on buying only to lease the same property for 9000. a year.

{{< socialpreview url="https://thefairhopetimes.blogspot.com/2020/03/another-economic-crisis-looming.html" >}}

Absolutely no one wanted the recreation land to be located next to the airport. Burrell Boone and Brown pushed the purchase down the throats of the citizens.

Lost Opportunity, now Fairhope has to cut 2.6 million because the three Bâ€™s had a plan of their own.

Sewer projects and capital improvements may also be delayed.

Now we need 2.6 million not 9000 dollars a year for a farming lease.

This CATALYST council has been the worst Fairhope has ever seen. Please remember Aug 25th is the municipal election and vote the CATALYST council OUT.
