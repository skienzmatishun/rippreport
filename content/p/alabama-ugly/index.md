Alabama is a beautiful state, with a very ugly side, white collar crime, aka political corruption. The corruption flourishes due to oversight agencies aiding and abetting the corruption by not doing their job. Accountability, ethics and rule of law have been abandoned by the Ethics Commission, Judiciary, Bar Association and the ever silent Attorney General.

The rule of thumb is that if the politician is Republican then protect him from any exposure or prosecution, at all costs.

That is why Alabama is the most corrupt state in the United States.

For weeks all these agencies have held their nose’s, made preposterous excuses or hidden in silence. They never took any of the allegations, nor admissions, of the Director of the Ethics Commission, Tom Albritton, seriously. They ignored the obvious prediction that more damaging information was coming down the track.

The latest Lagniappe article pulls back the curtain, on ugly side of Alabama.

Regions Bank, the Ethics Director, lawyers and now a circuit court Judge, all have their fingers in the pie. The Mabel Amos Memorial Trust has been their secret piggy bank. Speaking of banks the trust, and it’s millions, are harbored at Regions Bank. That could make some potential charges federal, such as money laundering, tax evasion, wire fraud, and conspiracy. What about banking laws and mismanagement of the trust?

It is your responsibility to something too!

Mr. Tommy Gallion, well known and respected Montgomery attorney, has been hired by Leigh Manning, a relative of Mabel Amos. If a lawsuit is filed then you can expect for it to get much uglier.

Mr. Gallions book is about greed power and political corruption, in Alabama. The Mabel Amos Memorial Trust has all the elements of the book, Greed, Power and Political Corruption.

The Executive Director of the Ethics Commission should be removed from his position immediately.

The Mabel Amos Memorial Trust, trustees, bank and recipients of the trust, should be thoroughly investigated, hopefully by the Feds.

Stay Tuned folks this train ride is far from over.
