 From my comment May 22nd

"When it’s over, they will make some claim without evidence. They’ll take it to court. They will get denied because evidence is required for court. That’s the purpose of court. You’ll whine and carry on that the failure of the court to take on your non-case was political and they never gave them a chance."
