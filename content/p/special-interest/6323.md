 In Joe Faust flyers that just came out it says "Joe Faust will bring Christian ethics back to Montgomery and will put transparency and integrity back in politics". My question is how long has Good Ole Joe been in this very position???  Just how many terms has he already served???   Why has he not already done this????   Some of the things he is now promoting he has had more than enough time in office to have already done these very things!!
