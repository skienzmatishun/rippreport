It is easy to see that people with special interests, Catalyst connections, or are from the Tim Can’t Club, do not want to see any change in Fairhope Government. They represent about 30% of the City’s population. They know a change of Government will cut off their access to slate candidates and greatly reduce their ability to “control” Fairhope, not Govern but “control.” The current Fairhope City Council is an “at Large Catalyst council” that has the most dismal record of any Fairhope Council in 20 years, they cannot even deliver a budget on time. WHY ? Would the citizens of Fairhope want to go backwards rather than forward?

FAIRHOPE CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT The Fairhope City Council is on a roundabout and doesn’t know where to exit. The present Council is an “at Large” council, they are not going to vote for change.

The Ripp Report predicts that in the next 10 days that we will see just who becomes the spokesman for a no vote. The Ripp Report will be sure to give you the back story.

There are three major groups in Fairhope pushing for a YES VOTE, for the Change of Government. Fresh Start Fairhope has provided information on the voting procedure for Fairhope residents on Nov. 6th.

FRESH START October 12, 2018: Update - Voting Procedures on November 6 Friends and Neighbors - Voting Procedures on November 6th Because the voting date of the Referendum was changed after the regular November 6th ballots (for state and county offices) were printed, the Referendum for Fairhope Council-Manager will be on its own separate ballot. In other words, if you are a Fairhope resident you will need to vote on two ballots before leaving your regular polling location.Unfortunately, it's even more complicated than just picking up two ballots. Here's how it's going to work...

1) You will go to your regular polling location and check in with your ID as you normally do, and you will be given the State and County Ballot. 2) After completing this ballot and putting it in the tabulating machine you will need to go to another desk located in or next to that area to receive your Fairhope Referendum Ballot, show your ID again to the staff at that special desk, mark your ballot, and put it in the special tabulating machine reserved for only the Referendum. 3) If you are uncertain of the procedures when you enter your polling place, just ask any of the staff so that you can vote once for the State and County Election, and vote again for the Fairhope Referendum. Fairhope residents vote in more than five polling locations, so it's quite possible that procedures will be slightly different from place to place. That's why it's important to ask for your Fairhope Referendum Ballot if it's not offered to you. Please share this information with as many people as your can. Thanks for your help and support!

Two more independent citizen groups are being formed in support of the YES vote

The Fairhope City Council is an “at Large” elected Council. Each of the members of the Council is deeply connected to the machine named for now, Catalyst; some by blood. The present council was…
