 Catalyst is betting that those that vote will fall for the “Christian Conservative” bull that they have been using all these years.
Yeah, right “Bring Christian ethics to Montgomery.”  Like he is the ONLY one to do it.
By the way Ripp, your are really pissing  off the county Republican Party. I was at a party gathering and the hierarchy is really sore at you.  They are calling you a liberal Democrat.  For shame!   I am here in Timber Creek which is the spiritual home to Catalyst and they will probably burn you in effigy on Halloween.
