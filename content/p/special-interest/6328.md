 You are so right  about Good Ole Joe!  He thinks all he has to say is I will bring good conservative Christian values with me then he flashes that toothy grin and pats you on the back and the people of Alabama and Baldwin County fall all over themselves getting to the polls to vote for him.  Joe is one that give Christians a bad name.  I am so tired of hearing candidates say I will bring good Christian Conservative Values with me to office. When I hear a candidate say that then I lean toward voting for their opposition.  Corruption is rampant in Baldwin County and the entire State of Alabama. We deserve what we get if we think this label is qualified to run for any office. Maybe the tide will start to turn. Good old Joe and his lovely wife have had a good time on your money!
