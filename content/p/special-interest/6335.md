 Agreed.....did you see that Alabama is recognized as the most corrupt state government in the US?  It is not surprising because all of these old men do nothing other than network to maintain their power.   They have a massive fear of a white female winning an election, but they would burn the state to prevent a brown person from even running for office.  
Faust has done nothing good that I can see; he has been in office forever and we are THE most corrupt state/county.  Danielle Mashburn Myrick is young and energetic and loves Baldwin County and she definitely deserves all of our votes!
