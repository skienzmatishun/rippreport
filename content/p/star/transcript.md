# Transcript

Harry Still hosts a special Backstory Podcast episode 100, advocating for individual opinion sovereignty and defying majority consensus. Guest Mr. Russian joins live from the studio. State auditor Jim Ziegler announces a gubernatorial campaign, promoting Alabama as a gun sanctuary and launching a GoFundMe to raise funds, citing $63M annually diverted from gas tax for roads as a key issue. He criticizes political interference in transportation planning, noting that MPO plans are politically driven, not need-based, and that South Alabama is unfairly disadvantaged. Ziegler vows to audit the Alabama Department of Transportation and redirect funds to highway bonds. He defends personal choice in health decisions, including vaccination and mask use, but acknowledges tension when state or school mandates impose restrictions.  

Ziegler calls for a special session on September 27 to address Alabama’s prison crisis, proposing a new plan using $400M in Rescue Plan funds to build state-owned prisons via low-interest bonds, cutting costs by one-third. The plan, however, fails to address guard and prisoner safety, drug use, violence, or rehabilitation—key concerns raised by the DOJ’s 2020 lawsuit over unconstitutional conditions. Federal pressure threatens a prison system takeover unless reforms occur. Meanwhile, the Alabama Secretary of State is surprised by Mike Lindell’s visit on September 17, who purchases a complete copy of the state’s voter registration list for $10,000, claiming to audit it and finding few dead voters. Lindell, CEO of a pillow company, enters with a cross, confusing the secretary; he later meets with Governor and Secretary of State, raising questions about election integrity. Lindell denies legal standing to access the list, which is publicly available only via fee.  

Lindell’s visit, seen as a potential "photo op," lacks substantive discussion, especially after he was not invited to meet with John Merrill, whose controversial text messages resurface. The host criticizes Lindell’s lack of expertise in elections, emphasizing that voting is a state and local responsibility. In a separate development, the agriculture commissioner promotes hemp cultivation, while a Baldwin County state rep raises concerns about political appointments tied to medical cannabis, with his twin brother leading the Medical Cannabis Association. The state treasurer, John McMillan, steps down to lead the medical cannabis board, a move seen as strategic given his prior interest in cannabis. Governor Ivey appoints former treasurer Young Boozer (Raines) back to his post, prompting a lighthearted remark on the name.  

A July booster campaign in Israel shows a tenfold increase in protection for those 60+, with waning immunity noted in older adults. The U.S. FDA and CDC evaluate booster rollout, initially targeting 65+ and high-risk groups, rejecting broad public boosters despite earlier promises. CDC data shows vaccines still protect against severe disease, hospitalization, and death, though breakthrough infections and waning immunity raise concerns. The Biden administration announces 500 million international doses, though critics call it inequitable—like giving life jackets to those already equipped. About 45 million Americans may eventually receive boosters.  

In Fairhope, a 56M-gallon sewer overflow discharges into a public beach, prompting a 2024 settlement with ADM and the AG over negligence and a public warning system for Vibrio exposure. The Mabel Amos Memorial Fund raises ethics concerns after Tom Albritton’s children receive $120K in scholarships. Montgomery County officials face ethics violations: board members orchestrate decisions then abstain, including a $816K bungalow purchase tied to the mayor’s family trust, a city lease to Fairhope appointees, and a no-bid contract for Robert Brown. A mandamus petition seeks re-review, though the Ethics Commission dismisses it on standing grounds. Calponesi defends a $3M referendum for a feeder pattern, calling it democratic despite not living in the area.  

The legislature passes a law extending municipal election terms from four to five years, but legal analysis shows such extensions can only occur by moving elections forward—making the change invalid. The host suspects a lawsuit. Auburn University ranks highest in US News’ “best value” list; the University of Alabama drops due to high non-teaching salaries. Rob Hobart criticizes Steve Flowers for inaction tied to Senator Shelby. Norm Macdonald dies after hiding his cancer for nine years, performing publicly and recording a Netflix special—only one person in California scores perfectly on the O.J. Simpson 75-page jury questionnaire. An Australian man drinks 15 draft beers in a row, and the Melbourne riots are called a “great riot.” The host jokes about silencing an Australian accent, asserting no one can push the button to mute the president—only the president makes strategic decisions independently.
