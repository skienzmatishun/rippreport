Facebook really did a number on thousands of people that spent years building their sites. We were blocked out of our Facebook sites The Ripp Report and Francis Paul Ripp. To communicate or follow us please join the new sites <a href="https://www.facebook.com/rippreport" >Ripp Report</a> and Francis Ripp. Our .com site remains the same RippReport.com</a>
