 "For the right reasons!" Not so fast! 

"Anyonebutkarin" is correct, just because someone is elected as a part-time council does not exclude them from doing business with the city. Nor does it exclude them from having friends that do business with the city. If it did then there would be very few people that qualify for election as a council member. Queen Karin the First of Fairhope (QKFF) would have a conflict because anything the queen proposed to benefit the downtown could benefit her business. Actually, since the mayor is a full-time position there would be more of a conflict. 

Individuals that are part-time are allowed to make a living and keep friends. The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled on this in the past. 

As far as QKFF, well, the queen has arrived, so go about your business, she is here to save Fairhope, now go about your business, my supporters know I am great and without any conflicts, go about your business. 

The only people that think they know are the mayor's supporters, clueless at best! 

Strike Fast! Strike Hard!
