 Fairhope has a corruption problem. It is with the council, not the mayor's office. We may have to wait until we can get a new council to make progress. Boone and Burrell are making money off of their positions. Boone's son, through variously named LLC's, is making bank off the city. Jack has several ventures in motion through the AA and he gets juice from the other scams they have going thru the council. The new guys on the council are dumber than a box of rocks to follow B&amp;B's lead. I guess they will find out.
