 Jester Triple Six might be taken slightly more seriously is s/he wasn't so aggressive and antagonistic and always resort to silly name-calling like a grade-schooler. Such is the trademark of bullies everywhere, not smart enough to engage someone in intelligent conversation but still so full of themselves they feel compelled to verbally vomit over every Ripp Report post.
