 Ripp, I thought you were against corruption? It seems you feel like it is okay because someone you supported is now mayor! So you are okay with QKFF hiring two individuals that lack the education, WB has never held a job more than three years and in some cases, not even a year, so what successes can some have when only working in a job for a year or two? There no long-term track record. You are okay with the mayor's office hiring friends that are not qualified and paying them some of the largest salaries within city government? So we need to stop "bitching?" Typical QKFF supporter.
