 That's  the kind of people like the  Baldwinwatcher and all the people that chose not to even try to work together to make Fairhope a great place. That's what we have to put up with. Even if everyone is at fault. We should still be able to resolve issues without people saying so many hateful and terrible things. We know who they are. They say it in public all the time. What a disgrace. Would love to catch them saying that in front of any of our children. Take that kind of mess and go on with your life.
