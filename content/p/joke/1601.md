 Maybe but I think not. Jester Triple-Six is probably a narcissist and has a 3rd grade education as their group can't get over things. They can only scream and complain against one side even when you agree that there are problems on both sides that need to be addressed. They certainly didn't defend themselves after being called unpatriotic!  That is all I needed to know. No more jester crap or strike hard strike stupid. Next subject!  The can say all they want to say. Falling on deaf ears from hear on! Bless their hearts! Glad we made them laugh though. That's a positive!  We laughed too!! Hey. Might have started something here. Lol. Have a super day!!!
