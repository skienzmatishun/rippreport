JOKE llp.

Have you noticed that no one on the Fairhope City Council wants to address any questions about the soccer fields!

In addition to all the other issues that Fairhope faces, the soccer fields have yet to become an issue. I am sure that the council will not take action to investigate anything themselves.

What is needed is a citizens committee, independent of the council, to thoroughly investigate the soccer field complex from purchase to present. Review all the contract documents and sub contractors, identify where fill material came from and cost of grading etc. Everything.

This was done with the Sen. Pittman BP Fraud Complaint,

A 130 page report was written and a 40 page supplement by a group of 6 to 8 citizens of Fairhope. Sen. Pittman has so far escaped any ethics or criminal charges however his actions are embedded in the minds of his constituents and it will cost him at the polls.

The purchase of the land stunk worse than the airport authority:

Please note the document that lists the owners, JOKE LLP, the JOKE is on Fairhope,

Where did all the money go, 5 to 6 million, and who benefited? GOB’S

The soccer fields were negotiated for construction under Mr Boone and Mr Burrell’s last term in office, remember that.

WHO WANTS TO HEAD THE COMMITTEE? THE FINAL REPORT WILL BE PRESENTED TO THE MAYOR, CITY COUNCIL and MADE PUBLIC
