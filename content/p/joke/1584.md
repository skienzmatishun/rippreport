 All of you (though very few) are about as stupid as a box of rocks. If you have to bring all this up over all the corruption that is going on in Fairhope. You must be bored to death and kin to the whole council. Strike Hard! Strike Fast! Did I hurt someone's feelings. Boo Hoo! How did we ever do anything without you and your wealth of knowledge. You get the Bullshit award for 2017!  Go do something positive with your life if you know what that word even means?
