 Actually, I agree with much of your post. The infrastructure is what needs attention.  I also agree that the Mayor is throwing away our taxpayer dollars by hiring the two most unqualified employees on the east coast.  I do believe that anything that is good for downtown Fairhope is good for all of Fairhope so I disagree with the posters who accuse Karin of making decisions that benefit her bookstore. We all knew that she owned that store before she threw her hat into the ring.....it has nothing to do with her job as mayor and I wish that people would stop trying to connect her store to her job as Mayor. Her husband runs that store and he does it well, so I find it reprehensible for idiots to suggest boycotting her store b/c they don't like her decisions.  I don't like her decisions either.  However, her husband and daughters are not making the Mayor's decisions so don't punish them......I would bet a lot that Kiefer Wilson would never hire Botop or Maser even to bartend!
