 I was not inferring that the mayor had a conflict of interest on the downtown issues but trying to point out that only a full-time politician could have one. I think Kiefer is a nice guy, but given the crap, QKFF has pulled, I just stay way for the bookstore. 

I am not boycotting the bookstore just choose to stay way due to the political talk around the coffee shop. I am tired of hearing the lies. 

QKFF has made some really bad decisions. Please tell me what her sidekick-whistle britches (WB), has brought in something tangible except sniff in the microphone and make excuses for this and that? Please enlighten me on all these tangles WB has done in exchange for this salary of hers? 

When the QKFF wants to spend monies on the harbor, the clubhouse, on the golf course on the salaries, I would like to see what all of this is going to cost us!
