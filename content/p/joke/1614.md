 Jester. You are so funny. Why would you even say that we would never know if you had an LLC. You and your group are providing entertainment at its best  and we appreciate it.  The name Jester fits you perfectly. We don't care if you even have an LLC and that we we will ever find out about it. Lol!  We told you and you little group of munchkins that y'all fall on deaf ears now.  Don't care if you have a dozen LLC's. Y'all don't matter anyway. Your group is getting smaller and you have to bring in the kiddies into the picture to help fight for the Councilmen and the ones that have been fired. It's a proven fact that you all choose is not to work together no matter whose at fault to try and make Fairhope better. Y'all even agrees  that none of the Councilmen lied during their campaigns. I'm glad you are enjoying yourself. I'm sorry you will be disappointed when this is over with. Because y'all don't care in the first place. Now that it's raining. I guess y'all can't go and swing at the park. Gonna be a long 2 or 3 days for your group.  LLC'c are so easy to pull up that A fifth grader can do it. And you are worried that we will never know if you have an LLC. That hilarious! Don't too strike fast or hard. You might break a lamp or knock over your juice cup. Too funny!
