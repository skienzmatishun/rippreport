How do you select the best candidate for the job? In Baldwin County the first thing you do is eliminate the Catalyst candidate. Many years ago Lynn Stacy was a political operative in Baldwin County that would guarantee candidates a win. He represented the most hardened of the Baldwin County good ole boys, GOB. Then came Stacy Haygood and Elliott, Haygood became Mayor of Daphne and Elliott became a county commissioner. The name changed again to Catalyst. When that name began to stink the GOB changed the name again to Scott Boone Consulting, the stink remained.

{{< socialpreview url="https://rippreport.com/p/catalyst-aka-scott-boone-consulting/" >}}

Whatever name you call it, GOB or Catalyst, the purpose is clear-- Place select candidates in positions that will tow the line for the status quo, the good ole boys.

#### BOARD OF EDUCATION DISTRICT 2

CARRIE HOSIER, Is not Catalyst. She represents the parents and will answer parents' concerns. She is the candidate that has no baggage. She is not the rubber stamp vote School Superintendent Tyler wants. CARRIE is the polar opposite of her opponent, she did not switch parties in order to run. She has not sold her soul for donations that come with “conditions”. CARRIE represents transparency and parents.

Her opponent, Andrea Lindsey is Catalyst, a typical GOB candidate. Her first action as a candidate was to switch from the Democrat party to Republican party, 15 minutes before qualification. Why? Because she was TOLD to switch parties, she could not win as a Democrat. She is the Eddie Tyler and John Gray rubber stamp, that should be apparent. Her donations came from a School board attorney, Eddie Tyler’s wife, who happened to get a school system promotion the day after her donation, and developers.

It is YOUR choice, CARRIE, who will represent the parents and answer your questions while providing transparency, which does not exist presently within the Board of Education Board.

Or the Catalyst Candidate, the rubber stamp of Eddie and Gray? The party switcher and developers choice?

#### CIRCUIT CLERK ####

Circuit Clerk of Baldwin County is a position that the GOB, Catalyst, have controlled for years. Baldwin County deserves better. KIM EARL is the answer. New eyes, new ideas, independent thinking that is what Baldwin County deserves. We need to break the corrupt cycle that has had a stranglehold on Baldwin county citizens for decades. Kim has 35 years in the Circuit Clerk's office, she knows what needs to change because she has been a witness to the Good Ole Boys of Baldwin County and their self serving priorities.
