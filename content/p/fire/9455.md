 Watching this race closely. If catalyst loses with Hightower they will have a difficult time getting Mahones in over Karin.
Seems everyone is onto their tired and loathsome schtick.
The "Out-Jesus-Em" philosophy hasn't worked as well as it used to in the past. Last time Kant woke up the day of the vote and realized his father in law would not be able to "deliver" at the end of the day because there would be a state official overseeing the voting tabulations.  The jig was up.  Still is. This is the first real election this place has had in over 50 years. In the past everyone was completely and utterly jaded by the corruption of false reporting the actual votes.  They just made up what they wanted and had a local attorney post the results as "official." No more. Ripp is on them like a hound on a June bug. Thank you patriot Ripp. This place should build a statue to your crazy old ass!
