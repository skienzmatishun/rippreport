DON’T TAKE THE BAIT — VOTE FOR THE SLATE

The Fairhope City Council and Mayor got a rude awakening the last day of qualifications for the upcoming municipal election on Aug. 26. The entire council has now got challengers and they are taking an approach to the election a little different than the last 5 election cycles. They are running as a slate of candidates. So what we have is the status quo being challenged by candidates representing change.

This is a very good strategy because replacing 2 or 3 council members will not clear the way to eliminate the good ole boy culture of the current council and mayor. Knock out the council and the Mayor will have to listen to the council rather than colluding with the council.

If you are unsure as to who to vote for, may I strongly suggest voting out the incumbent council.

Please share with your neighbors and encourage them to vote Aug 26th.
