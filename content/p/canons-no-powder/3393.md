 Most of Fairhope's social &amp; economic elite believe that their affiliations with the local politicians will send good things their way (and they have been correct).  

 Many of them are older and find it difficult to comprehend the level of corruption here;  however, their kids/grandkids will be the ones who suffer from the toxic environment and the diminishing returns on property investment.
  
Why are the prominent local property owners/developers such as John Bethea, Mac Porter, Pat Achee, Cliff Pittman,  etc not speaking up and attending these Council meetings and demanding better actions by the City/County for the health of our City (and their families)? They live here also......are they silent because they are granted special favors?  I am not accusing anyone of anything but these guys are not shy when they want something from the City. 
At what point, do we demand that our Planning Commission &amp; City Council divulge all of their rewards.
