 What if our area goes for weeks without decent rainfall? What then? It all sounds good, until it isnt. Can you feel ok about swimming and fishng in our water then?  Then we finally have the big flush..and it is too much for the system to handle..more sewer in the bay. And by the way..there are many areas in the world..not just our slice of the pie, that doesnt have creeks and bays that ' flush' the sewage out.  Perdido Bay is one of those...close to home. They too are in a stack of **it. 
Having 3 people in my family that are microbiologist, biochemist...etc... Has brought me full face turn around about our sewage problems. It is very bad. Very sad....we must back our Mayor to the fullest and get this issue resolved. There may be folks that are truly criminal minded in charge. But my bet is, it took big kickbacks to look the other way for the years it took to get us in the mess we are in right now. And my feeling is, the citizens are truly tiring of this gross negligence and perhaps criminal behavior. It is my hope that we dont take much more abuse. And the jokers in the council now, have no ones interest at heart but their own. They all cowtow to Jack..and that is it.  That is grossly evident.
