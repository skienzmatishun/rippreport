 The way we stop criminal behavior from our representatives on the council is to attend a meeting, at a date we all discuss and agree on. From that point, we attend the meeting, and speak our minds....having NO regard for being arrested or any other such thing. It will definitely take sovereign citizens to overtake these people. WE ARE NOT IMPOTENT! But we will be rendered as such, if we continue to turn a blind eye and vent our frustrations out on this forum only. 
The purported arrests will be supercillious at best. They wont hold. Let them do it!!! And never stop with the mantra of what these folks have done to our community! Our city!! If we do not take charge of this situation..then God help us all. I am sick over what these parasites do to our mayor at every council meeting. Arent you?? When Karin is one of the only humans speaking out for our interest. The airport authority  folks need to be in jail...and yes, that property should come back to the citizens, as well as Fly Creek Marina..ad nauseum. We fnally have a mayor that looks after this city, amd people just crap on her....amazing. Lets get a date for that meeting??!!
