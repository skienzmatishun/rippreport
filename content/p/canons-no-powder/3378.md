 That's so funny. I guess you think that Mobile Bay flushes out everytime it rains and it's deep from one side of the bay way to the other. Fact is that over the years with all the sewer and chemical plant deposits the average depth is less than 4 feet. Yet you are another dumbass trying to make an excuse for human error. You can't even eat bass (or anything else for that matter) out of Fish River because of the human sewage that that has continued to run in it for years. We all have to be so careful in this world because stupid uneducated people like you are amongst us. Don't worry though. Even our kids know just how stupid you people are. Rain!!!! It doesn't take all the human shit and flush it all out clean. It's in the marshes, rivers, streams and even in the blood of all the fish and wildlife. You want to see a really true dumbass. Look in the mirror!  We have had to put up with people like you for years!!!  Rain and tides help. Mother Nature can't clean up after all of us. It's meant for the natural environment, not the one we over expose it to.
