 Another dumbass. Just ask Bay Keeper. I'm sure the storm will was out some of the crap. But this is a onetime flushing. We have gone the last 5 months with high levels of many terrible types of bacteria. Some as high as 20 (twenty) times the normal. There is your fact. Why don't you just leave this area. You and your family seem to stink it up pretty good in the first place.
