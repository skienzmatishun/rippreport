 You are exactly correct. This is nothing new. The levels of crap in Alabama has reached a new high. Hurricanes, tornadoes or 10 inches of rain a day will wash the crap and filth off all of our politicians especially the Fairhope City commission and were it all started years ago, the Baldwin County Commissioners. Crooks and Drunks!!!
