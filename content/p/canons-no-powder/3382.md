 Where is the data? We are waiting on it. Oh, another brain fart I guess. Typical A personality. You people are everywhere. We are thinning y'all out slowly.  It's sad that we all work so hard to have a good life while having to work side by side with those of you who do not even understand that we all are responsible for saving the environment. Thank God that some of us do!  Go back to sleep or go at the end of your dock and have a drink. You are worthless.
