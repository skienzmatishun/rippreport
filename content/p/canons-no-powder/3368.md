 You are correct, there is no tide that flushes the 'crap' out of the Fly Creek but there something called 'rain' that does indeed flush all creeks. So, Anonymous, you appear to be the dumbass! Rains are the best cleaning of all impurities with the soils, and any waste is usually washed out to the bay then storms, which in turn the currents usually push all waste in the sea which in turn assumed with the ecosystem. If the currents do not wash impurities then most storms usually do, it is all a cycle. That is why septic tanks work so well...dumbass!
