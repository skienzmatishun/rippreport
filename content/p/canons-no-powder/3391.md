 When it comes time to upgrade the sewer we will all have to pay for it.  The city and county government NEVER makes the builders pay for the impact that their subdivisions have on us.  They make the money and we have to pay for it.  This is because the city and county governments are in collusion with the builders.  Maybe a RICO violation.
