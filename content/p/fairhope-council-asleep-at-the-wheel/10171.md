 Dammit Georgia!  I’ve gotta give you a pat in the back. Way to go. Made my day and the Foley man, you are spot on about the Soccer fields!  They are a disgrace and a very TRUE EXAMPLE of what the Fairhope city council stands for and just how much they “do not “ care for us citizens of Fairhope. I cannot begin to share enough with you, Georgia and you Foley Man, just how sorry the Fairhope Council really is. Maybe next week will tell.  Or maybe we will get really lucky and the storm will was was  Boone and Burrell down the drain along with the rest of the Shit this council has put us through.
