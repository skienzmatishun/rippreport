 You are right!  I set up my FB account in 2009 because I had a premonition that we would get a political storm here in town.  But you are right, I have become more acitve on FB recently, mainly out of concern for current politics, and friends that work for the City. All I did was ask why the council is not allowed more time with the budget, why the personal attack? "Anonymous"?
