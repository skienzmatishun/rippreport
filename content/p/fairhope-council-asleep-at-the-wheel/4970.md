 I heard that Robert "Swipe your Town" Brown is off the council now that he is building his dream home on fly creek. What a cr@ppy thing to do.  Just like the bay he is polluting. I also heard that boone and conyers are also not running. It looks like the rats are jumping ship. I guess its just jay and jack...
