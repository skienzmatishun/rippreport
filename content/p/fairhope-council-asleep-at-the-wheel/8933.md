 Betty, the reason many of us post as anonymous is because Baldwin is not Mobile.  Furthermore, the many people who post if exposed would bring retribution on us and our families.  Ripp was  threatened with jail at one time when he tried to speak before the Council.  The Sheriff is a Catalyst.   If our names were made public we would face hell
We are waiting for the next election with the feds and Secretary of State to monitor
There is so much crookedness in this county.
