 We just need to vote them out. When Jack gets off the council then the airport either needs to be returned to the city or it needs to pay its own mortgage 
Next Boone needs to go and he can take his Catalyst with him.   When the people become aware of this group it will be a liability for a candidate to use this group.   
Brown made his money off his hometown without bids and he needs to go. Hometown Brown?   Yeah right
Conyers just wanted to make contacts for his bank and does not care about you unless you have something he wants   He thought being on the council would be a prestigious stint and walked into a cat fight
Robinson you either need to take a stand and stop riding the fence.  We are watching your voting record
Karin was elected by the very same people that elected you guys on the council.    She has just as much right to be there as the rest of you
