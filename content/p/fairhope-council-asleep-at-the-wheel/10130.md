 When Chris Brown was running, I had a very good conversation with him and his vision for Fairhope.  I voted for him.  BIIIIG MISTAKE!!!.  He has definitely disappointed me an I image a few hundred others when he hooked up with Boone and Burrell.  I also have known Sherry Sullivan for a good while....'nuff said.  I definitely will not be voting for the Catalyst Cabal.
