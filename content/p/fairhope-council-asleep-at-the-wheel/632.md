 The situation going on in Fairhope is much like what's going on in Washington.  People can clearly see that things are not right but are loathe to accept proven facts and instead think that because they may not be personally impacted by negative decisions that the Council is making then why should they speak out against them. So many times I see a variation of the comment "Fairhope is great...why do we need change?"  It's not that we need change for the sake of change...it's that we need change to make sure that Fairhope STAYS the town that we all love.  Turning a blind eye to decisions that will ultimately affect our little part of the world is what so many are doing right now when it comes to bad decisions in Washington that will one day affect us all.
