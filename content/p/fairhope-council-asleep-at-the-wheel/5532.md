 The problem with waiting to "vote them out" is that they will do a lot of damage in another 2-12 years.  I agree with Georgia that moving Burrell out of the lead chair and having another council person sit there is a good start, and that could and should happen immediately.  But I'm not sure Burrell's little soldiers are willing to stand up to him enough to make that happen.  It's a small step toward change, but perhaps a good one.
