 Totally agree with you!  I have become increasingly aware that the  majority of the men on the Council are more concerned with trading favors and puffing up their egos than they are with what is best for out City.  Truly it is time for a clean Council; if Burrell had a conscience, he would resign now and never run again.  He is toxic.
