 Correct me if I'm wrong - and I may be.  But I thought the insurance company made the decision on whether or not to settle a suit, not the Council.  Obviously I would EXPECT the Council so want to settle, because somehow that would give some legitimacy to the fired employees' claims.  But I'm just not real sure they have the final word on whether or not that happens.
