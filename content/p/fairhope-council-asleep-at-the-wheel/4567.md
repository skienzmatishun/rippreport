 Another Catalyst flunky trying to justify their evil ways.  Even their conscious catches up with them and keeps them from sleeping st night. You see, when you let growth get out of hand you bring in people that do not agree with you.  This is what you have done.  Now face the fruition of yurt out of control growth.  Like a cancer your Catalyst body is infected.
