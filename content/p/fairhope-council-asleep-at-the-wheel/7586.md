 I see where the Mayor tried to implement a moratorium.  HA HA!  Do you think the Council would ever allow this?  DR Horton, Corte, Bellaton, and  Robert Brown ( a partner with Cliff Pittman - a developer) would never let a moratorium be enacted unless they get all their projects approved first before the moratorium kicked in.  
Karin may be a lot of things but she is not owned by any home builder or special interest.  She is however owned by the people of Fairhope.  She is also tough as nails considering how she has to stand up to the bullies on the Council.  
She is The Iron Lady of Fairhope.
She is more mayor than what the people have in Daphne for a mayor or what we have to put up with here in Spanish Fort for a mayor.
