 Ripp I do hope you are right, but Catalyst is so intertwined with so many things.   It is going to take the ENTIRETY of the voters to wake up.  Unfortunately the voters are too busy working overtime paying mortgages on the houses built by Catalyst developers and paying taxes to support the Catalyst politicians
Maybe the voters deserve to get what they get for their ignorance
