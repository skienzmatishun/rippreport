 Council ignored the meetings planned for them. Now they're sitting back and contributing to the rumors. 

The plan has been in newsletters, state of the city on 2019 and 2020 and the mayor has been talking about this opportunity since 2017.  

It is council who holds back plans behind closed doors. Don't confuse the way they handle communication with someone who has been very open.
