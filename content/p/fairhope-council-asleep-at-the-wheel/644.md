 Thanks for the heads up! I'll tell my son, who took that photo, that someone is using it. I have not started any petitions, and have not signed any, I think they are a waste of time. And I've been happily employed for 15 years in Mobile, so don't know what that disgruntled comment means. But thanks "anonymous"
