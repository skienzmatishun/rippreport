 The different Fairhopes is nothing new.   Many of us old timers have seen this town transform from a small community to a suburban city with oversized and over priced houses.   The builders keep building them and the younger couples stretch their budgets to buy them so they can park their leased luxury cars.
With this covid thing going around, watch and see these overstretched people be kid bare because they are trying to give the appearance of wealth.
For years the city has tried to keep the minority outside the city limits.   Just on the other side of Thomas Hospital is outside city limits.  But go for miles East and you are in the city limits.   I have seen Fairhope annex East but not South.  Why? Minorities 
Why does the council run at large instead of districts? Minorities.  
How many minorities on council? Zero.  Itâ€™s all white men.
