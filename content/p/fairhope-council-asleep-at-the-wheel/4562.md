 I look at it this way. We have the land which we overpaid for but I think it was unwise, not fraudulent.  I think we should immediately prevent any development and then decide later exactly how to handle the land. The land will be the same. If you leave it alone I promise it will still be there next year. It does sound like there should have been controlled burning and we should have been doing that. Mr Dyas knows as much about that stuff as anyone. I personally think it should be either unblemished or have very limited trail access. As long as you leave it be we don’t need to rush. On the other hand this has gone on far too long and something needs to be decided sooner rather than later.

Whether or not anything criminal happened the truth is we paid way too much for the soccer field, this land, and too much for the land near the airport.  Stupid is almost as bad as criminal.  Just because some appraiser affixes a ridiculous price to a property doesn’t make it worth it.
