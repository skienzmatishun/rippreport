 So if a federal investigation would be going on causing these three to jump ship, why would Burrell and Robinson still stay on?   I would say that the three would be the more innocent ones and one of the two remaining to be a ring leader.  
I would ponder that if an investigation was the case, Burrell would be the one to jump ship.  What am I not getting?
