 Who supervised the purchase of the property for the Authority ??? Is there an audit to see where the funds went and were there off balance sheet commissions ?  In 3rd world countries , my experience has been, that entities conduct business and then transfer debts to the state -in this case the city ! Not knowing to the taxpayer ! Smells to high heaven !
Would welcome a visit with the Mayor to explain how it happens!
