 It will be another two years before we can sweep these guys out.  Until then, we can sweep out the candidates this June that are Catalyst.  This will indicate to the Good Ole Boys that we know them.  
What is even more, sweeping out the Catalyst folks at the county level will send a message to the council that the voters elected Karin and she needs to be left alone - or they will be sept out too.
