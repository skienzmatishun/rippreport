 Insurance would want to settle quickly rather than litegate, you are correct. The problem is council (lead by come fly with me jack) stuck their nose where it didn't belong with a hiring freeze and unnecessary attention. These are at will employees. End of story. 
Then council,  with the city attorney's help, subpoenaed records just to hand over to claimants attorneys. It still proved nothing but perpetuated a non-issue in the bias "Courier Opinion Blog" (GCN).   

It is clear council's goal (lead by come fly with me jack) helped these claimants cash in. 

Remember too, Jay is close friends with Sullivan. He's the one that lead and endorsed subpoenaing the records to give to her attorney. BIG conflict.
