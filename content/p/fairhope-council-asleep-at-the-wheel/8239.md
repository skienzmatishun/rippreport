 It will be interesting to see if Catalyst changes its name now that Ripp has exposed this group.  It was once called Elliott, Haygood, and Stacey before it was called Catalyst.  If it does change its name then what will it be called?  
What makes Catalyst at its core, whatever it is called?  Is it the politicians that utilize it?  Is it the developers that fund it?  We need to be able to identify this group because Ripp has exposed what it does which is corrupt government.
It is very likely that the people running this group will try to hide their tracks.  Because of this, we need to be able to spot this group so we can call the politicians out when they hire Catalyst and sell their souls to this mafia-like group and go against the people just to get elected.
When I see that a politician uses this group, I want this politician to answer to the voters so I want to know how to spot this group whatever it is called or will be called.
