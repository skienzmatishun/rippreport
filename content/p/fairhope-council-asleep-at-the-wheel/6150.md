 I don’t see why there is such a big rush. The council and mayor all have 2 years left on their terms so any change won’t be in effect for 2 years. I don’t see the problem with taking even a month or two to make everything more clear. Those who are clamoring to vote on this Oct 2 might find a lot of no votes from people who are still unclear about what the vote means. If I don’t have a clear understanding of an issue I tend to vote AGAINST change. If people were thinking ahead they would use the extra time to draw district lines, preferably several, and get an informal vote on the same ballot
so that issue can be dealt with. The devil is always in the details. I understand that the council would prefer at large if they had their druthers but for now I think there is time enough to make more people understand what they are voting on. Odds are that 2-4 of the present council won’t run again anyhow. I guess a CM could start before 2 years. Maybe that part would work. No one has talked about it that I have heard.
