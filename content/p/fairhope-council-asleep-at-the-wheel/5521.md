 I have a question for the snoopers and schmoozers out there. Let's see what we can find out with a little cybersleuthing and plain detective work.

Ok. Here we go.  

Jack Burrell claims to be an aerospace engineer "with security clearances" and works on weapons systems. He tells everybody this he can.

He said at the meeting the other night that he was driving to Huntsville right after the meeting. He said his employer is"Integration Innovation, Inc" and it is listed on his statement of economic interests filed with the Secretary of State. Got this online.

Has anyone ever called "Integration Innovation" and asked for Jack Burrell?

Do they know about his police record?
