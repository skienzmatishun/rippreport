 I did not know you supported the Bees.
Well, I guess we will learn how popular they are. Just by talking to friends in town I sense that everyone wants Karin for one more term, since she deserves to finish up her public service. I understand she will not seek a 3rd term. This is leadership, my fellow citizens.

Speaking of, our current council three is self-serving. They need replacing.
