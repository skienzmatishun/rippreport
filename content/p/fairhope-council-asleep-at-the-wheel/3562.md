 Aunt Pittypat,  the developers are either the politicians or are financing their campaigns.  So many people who don’t have a history here and don’t care are voting for them.   We have been invaded by them. They have taken over.   I think it is too late.    I would like to blame the group from Georgia who now run the place but I think it is all of our fault.
