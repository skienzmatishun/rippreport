It would give the Mayor a voice (and a vote) among the men on the council and would take away much of the animosity that has been heaped upon her (for no good reason) because the City Manager would then be responsible.  Naturally, the council would absolutely HATE the idea, which is an added bonus.  From the little I understand, each council person would also be responsible for a particular district, not at-large like we have now.  Now, finding somebody qualified who would want such a crappy job might be the real challenge, but who knows, people still go to work for Trump so maybe not.  I would also like to see term limits included in such a vote, which is something else the Mayor discussed she wanted during her campaign. I honestly don't see a downside to any of this and I hope residents give this consideration.
