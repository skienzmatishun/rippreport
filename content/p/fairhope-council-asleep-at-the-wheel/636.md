 It sounds like it took time to get an actual good budget as she was breaking down everything to get a good true picture - instead of grouping so much together (if I was guessing it was grouped together to hide some things) - that was the tactics of past few Mayors!!  She is truly trying to help Fairhope &amp; uncover the mess that has gone on &amp; HAS BEEN hidden.  Give her a chance &amp; stop criticizing before you know what she is actually trying to do,  of course if you have lived in Fairhope for less than 35 to 40 years you have no idea &amp; new residents were fed crap about a lot of things.  One was Kants comment "that before he was Mayor there was hardly anything in Fairhope &amp; boarded up stores". That was totally laughable to long term residents - Fairhope was self efficient - every kind of shop you can think of, furniture stores, bakeries, shoe repair shop, grocery stores. Bicycle repair shops, movie theater, several women's clothing stores, men's clothing stores, bowling alley, skating rink, Bedsoles Department store that has clothes for the whole family,  shoes for the whole family, bed clothes for the whole family &amp; on &amp; on - MUCH MORE of a variety than we have now - just who was Kant trying to fool???  (I guess newcomers). We are sick of that lying &amp; hiding things
