 Thanks for the promo. Coach Bryant was traveling to Arkansas to interview for the head coaching job the day Pearl Harbor was bombed. Turned around, headed home and joined the Navy to help protect his country instead. However, Coach Bryant only honed my athletic skills that I acquired from my high School Coach, W. C. majors and his staff.  My ETHICS, ability to work hard and my dedication were all instilled in me by my parents.  Coach Bryant recognized these attributes in me and my parents. I believe I have represented my parents and family well in each of these areas.  I also believe Coach Bryant would be proud of me also.  Also, he would have been man enough to sign his name to his comments!  He also spelled my name correctly. Vince BoothE
