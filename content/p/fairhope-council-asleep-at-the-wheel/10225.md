 This Fairhope Council thing continues to be an embarrassment to the city. It’s obvious how the corruption works here in Fairhope with our city council and former mayor.  I don’t understand how anyone would consider voting that same bunch back in. Well, unless they could benefit from their bought and paid for deals. Or they’re just not bright folks. Why do you think Tim Kant continues to hover in the wings??  He needs a piece of that pie that he had for years before being voted out of office.  Vote Karin Wilson back in and Jack Burrell and Friends OUT!!!    VOTE for FAIRHOPE
