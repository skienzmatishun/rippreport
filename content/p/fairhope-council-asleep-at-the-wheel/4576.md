 Dude has been sued four times. 

Won every case.

Has a case against City council chairwoman Burrell.

Marine is the presiding judge.

Gonna be nice when Ripp gets a six figure check for being deprived his constitutional right to free speech.

I'm sure he will use the money to bury catslyst candidates going forward.
