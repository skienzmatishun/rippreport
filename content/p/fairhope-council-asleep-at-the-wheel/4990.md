 Ah. Wasn’t he on the Art Center’s Board when he awarded himself the contract to work on the very building he’s a board member of. Robert, please show us the bidding process. Because if you made even half of the $450,000 that has been claimed. You need to resign tomorrow. If we find out you did. You will resign soon.
