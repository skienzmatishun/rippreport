 Donâ€™t just blame Burrell but blame Corte who is a big Catalyst developer and contributor
This Catalyst group is a big networked outfit  with money and connections who are selling this place out.   When they are done this place will be like Gwinnett County and we will have to pay their impact fees
The residents of Baldwin County just will not wake up and see what this outfit is doing
