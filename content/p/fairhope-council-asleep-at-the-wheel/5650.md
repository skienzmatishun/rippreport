 So now they come clean.  From their Facebook page:

Freshstartfairhope - Thank you for your questions and comments regarding the Fresh Start Fairhope petition form, and its difference from the one being circulated by the Mayor. As we discussed in our meeting last Thursday night, and which was confirmed at the City Council meeting Monday night, both petitions are approved. 

The Fresh Start Fairhope volunteers and supporters voted to seek At-Large council representation under the Council/City Manager system, whereas the Mayor's petition specifies the so-called Districting plan. That is the substantive difference between the two. As for specific wording used on the Fresh Start Fairhope petition, we have conformed to legal requirements. 

Thank you for your continuing participation in this grassroots voter process.
