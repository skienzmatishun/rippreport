 JTS - I consider Ripp more a citizen of Fairhope than most voters because he stays engaged and looks out for what is good for Fairhope citizens.  Why are you spending your time on commenting here?  Obviously he has struck a nerve with you or you somehow feel threatened by what he says.  

What do you think Ripp's agenda is? He isn't getting paid to write for a newspaper that sells ads like fake GCN/Courier.  People read what he has to say because he isn't a politician, he's not getting paid to do this and he keeps citizens up to date on corruption in Fairhope and Baldwin Co.  The only people who have a problem with Ripp are special interests.
