 Ripp, you have exposed Catalyst as the political machine owned by the developers who are stealing our quality of life.  So much makes more sense now that we know what is really going on.
Elliot, Haygood, Stacey, Boone, Cox, Prebble, and the rest of the bunch have been raping this county for too long.  Any loss for Catalyst is a win for us
