 Indeed, Ripp does not vote, does not pay Fairhope taxes nor can he hold any elected office, but Ripp always states that he just tells the facts, but as usual, he is causing trouble in a place where he does not live. He wants to sue, he supports the mayor and her high budgets but he does not pay a dime in Fairhope City taxes.
