 Why is it that people who live outside of ‘Fairhope City Limits’ can not vote on the city officials? 
Don’t you think if you have a Fairhope address, you should have a ‘right to vote’.  Considering that the city officials give out building permits on property outside of city limits.   Don’t you think that would be more of a fair vote?
