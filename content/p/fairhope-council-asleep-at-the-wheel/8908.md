 I question the backbones of Robinson and Boone - if they even have them. The other members of the council need to realize that they, as elected officials, have just as much right to be on that council as does Burrell.  Yet they cower to him.  Then these guys go home to their families to be the "men" of their houses?  
Geez, come on guys, where are your vertebral columns?
By the way, for those who work for Catalyst, the term "Chordata" is a biological phylum that groups animals with backbones.  Take note, Baby Boone.
