 It won't ever happen.  In the first place, I'd be shocked if there was ever a doubt as to whom would be awarded that contract.  Cliff Pitman has a stellar reputation (he just happens to have a partner with much less integrity than he has).   In the second place, Robert Brown is protected by Corte's cash (imho). When Brown ran for Council, he was vocally against the apartments at Fly Creek; once he won, he was all for the apartments because he stated that Corte was his mentor and he could vote for anything he wanted.  I'm sure that he will win again......Fairhope is nothing if not full of short-sighted voters who are willing to have their heads turned by snake oil salesmen.
