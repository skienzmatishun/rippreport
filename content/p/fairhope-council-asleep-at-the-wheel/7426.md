 Dear Georgia,
You nailed it.  You called it.  You see the council’s moves.
They want to put the property in a conservation easement to make people think that this area will remain as it is.  Then the voters will look the other way thinking that the Triangle will be safe from development.
Then, after a period of time, a deal will be made in the back rooms where some of the property will be sold and condos will be built.   Guess who will be somewhere in this deal?   A person whose last name begins with a “C.”
I have been here all my life and have watched the schemes of this bunch.  DO NOT TRUST THEM....EVER!    You are seeing way to much money at play here and this property is like a chum bucket and the players are greedy sharks.
Picture in your mind a feeding frenzy and you will see what is going on.
Hey Ripp, I just gave you an idea for your next graphic for your Freaky Friday post.
