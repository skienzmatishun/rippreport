 "State the facts and answer a simple question"....
Are you a lawyer? 
The facts are :
Ripp lives by the fire station on Parker Road( unusual placement), the Publix ( there's a story behind this one too),  the approved fly creek apartments, the FEMA funded replacment of a supposed sewer pipe failure in 2014 and the contaminated fly creek but yet you say he doesn't deserve to be called a Fairhope citizen?

We need districts, annexation, diversification and advocation for Fairhope!!
