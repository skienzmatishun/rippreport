 I don't think the catalysts will try to rig it this time.  They tried with the last mayoral election but the SOS scared them off. Catalyst will go to ground and reemerge as another campaign outfit.  Just keep an eye on the SOS campaign finance reports and follow the money - especially contributions coming from the big developers and going to the candidates.  Then see who the candidates pay off.  That there will show the money trail.
