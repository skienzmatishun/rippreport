 Initially, it really is hard to understand why you live in Fairhope when you hate it so much.   You have been doing the Ripp Report for 14 years and have never had good things to say about any council and each one is worse than the other.  Leave.  If not, give a plan for something, anything.

Also, you scream CONFLICT all day long.  Do you not see a conflict with raising taxes (1/2%) on gas for the downtown merchants.  Isn't the mayor a downtown merchant ?   Isn't that a CONFLICT?  Not saying that they don't deserve it, but shouldn't the mayor recuse herself from the vote and discussion?  If the mayor pushes for a tax for her business that is the very definition of CONFLICT.

Finally, since you are the great Ripp, and Catalyst is the problem, put your list of council candidates forward... who are you supporting?  Nobody carrying your flag....thought so.  

In fact you hitched your wagon to Attorney Harry Still who ran for city council in Bay Minette.  He got his ass handed to him in a district race in a dying city.  Terrible attorney, terrible political candidate and now terrible blogger.  Best mates with Ripp, fittingly.
