 When does it matter what Ripp posts. The entire Council is showing everyone plain as day that they do not give a shit about anyone but themselves. They all depend, just like the Catalyst, that all you people who really care continue to be Stupid and not go and vote. So the entire Council has shown they do not care about ethics. Follow up on some of these articles or go to the Council meetings and ask them for yourselves. They have no ethical boundaries. Yet they still screw us every chance they get. Bay Gazer, ask around, young or old, anyone with the name Jack Burrell in Fairhope is a F ing prick. Apple does not fall from the tree. Iâ€™m sure if you have kids, they are they same way.
