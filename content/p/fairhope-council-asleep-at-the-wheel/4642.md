 Your position would be a park before repairing the infrastructure. That has been the mindset of previous Mayor and council, that is why we have a 30 million dollar problem. Mayor Wilson has completed all the sewer and infrastructure studies, she has secured 10.8 million for sewer infrastructure. The Mayor and superintendents have also informed the council of the serious situation, the council is dragging it's feet on sewer infrastructure but pushing a park,???. Bottom line is that the triangle, as well as, Districts and Annexation should be decided by city referendum.
