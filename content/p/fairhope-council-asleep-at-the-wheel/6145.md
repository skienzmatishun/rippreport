 Zunk started out not objecting to districts, then he jumbled two laws and a poll and started backing at large. Zunk and fresh start want the election to go forward because they want change, even if it means going to districts. The council thought they had the power to push at large, they are at large, now they see their mistake and want to cancel or delay the election. I agree, election should go forward and council interference will be met with political consequences.
.The bottom line is the Mayor was right and the council dead wrong. Go to Mayor's site and city site and you will see the Mayor was dead on as early as june, the council tried to silence her and even filed a complaint, all for nothing.It is a Catalyst Council and they all need to go.
