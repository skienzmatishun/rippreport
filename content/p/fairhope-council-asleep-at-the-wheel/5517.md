 Agree with all.  I think that the best suggestion was that Burrell cede the Presidency of the Council to Robinson, probably the most genial of the members (but also an attorney).  After 6 years, this should be a no brainer.  I did notice that only the ever tipsy Kevin Boone declined.  This would be the best thing for the City; clearly Black Jack will never give up power so we need to find a way to make our other council members man up.  Interesting that last night no one other than Boone objected to BJ following the rules.  Perhaps we need to petition the Council to give them the goods to do the right thing.  Last night was amazing b/c, even though Black Jack was 'balls against the wall', the rest of them appeared ashamed.  What has BJ caught them doing?
