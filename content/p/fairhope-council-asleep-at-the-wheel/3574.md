 It's Sunday and I am trying to hold my tongue here. I will just say that Tucker Dorsey, Jack Burrell and Tripp Pittman all come from the same mold. You can make your own opinion of it. I just got back from church but, that doesn't give me the right to play the Christian card like these three always seem to be doing. Looking back. Pittman is finished, Dorsey will be gone and the way Burrell conducts himself and talks to people in the Council meeting is certainly not a way that I personally feel like acting as a Christian. We need help. Prayer is certainly a big part of the answer.
