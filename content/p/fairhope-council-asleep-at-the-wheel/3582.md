 That is so true. We are just dealing with 3 women who could give a rat's ass about Fairhope. Some even had relations with the ex Mayor Tim Kant and received all kind of favors and wasted city's money left and right while being paid a premium that none of them certainly earned and only took advantage of anything and everything and everyone they could. They are disgraceful and the most worthless emplyeee that we have had in years. First week that Mayor Wilson took over they should have had police escorted them out of the city's offices and told don't let the door hit them on their sorry asses on the way out. Disgusting individuals who were grossly overpaid and now want more. Same way Jack Burrell or the Councilmen would act. Jack Burrell had private conversations with all three of these people after they were fired and long before any lawsuit was filed. Jack Burrell actually advised this 3 shitasses, who adore Jack in how to get the most out of their lawsuits. This is totally against the Law and will be brought up at the appropriate time. I can hear you wondering what the hell you got yourself into Jack!!! There should already be a harassment suit file against you by the Mayor and other women in the city for your pathetic actions toward several woman in Fairhope and some of its city Employees.
