 More dumb totally false information from this MR. Ripp dude. The purchase of the property gaurantees that we will one day have a beautiful city owned  developement of some type.To be used by all our citizens for generations to come. The alternative would have been some undesirable development that would have been nothing but profit based. The total  amount spent by the city to aquire the property was well worth every dollar regardless of the price. Once developed  I hope they require a city sticker to utilize the property just like the beach. We won't have to see goofy rowdy Ripp because he doesn't live in our beautiful city. 

All thanks to our wonderful former Mayor Mr. Tim Kant.
