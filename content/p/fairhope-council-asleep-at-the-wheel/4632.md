 You can thank the council for this.  They were so busy trying to please the Good Ole Boys.  When the over building collapses the infrastructure then I hope these guys are prosecuted and barred from ever doing what they have done.
As for the rest of the county candidates they need to know the people are on to them.
It use to be you guys won 100 percent of your rigged elections.    Paul Ripp showed us that we do not have to tolerate your crookedness.
