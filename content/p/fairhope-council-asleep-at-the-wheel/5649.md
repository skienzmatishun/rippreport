 I don't know how many of y'all are following Fresh Start Fairhope's page but they are a sly bunch and surely up to no good.  Take for example this most recent post:  https://www.facebook.com/afreshstartforfairhope/posts/1012692708907394  Note the question posed and the non-answer.  I predict they will NOT provide an answer to her question. Why?  I don't know but I do know this:  their wheels are still turning and they are looking at a sneaky way to somehow secure at-large council positions.  There is back-room maneuvering going on right now, mark my words.
