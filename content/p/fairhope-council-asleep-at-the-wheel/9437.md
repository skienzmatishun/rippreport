 You do realize that the "bluff" is on the south side and is covered with kudzu. Very little trees are to be removed and bulldozing the bluff is total fiction. Please research the plan and attend the next meeting. This plan also allows people with disabilities, like veterans, to enjoy the park. It also displaces parking and adds a ton of common space areas for citizens.
