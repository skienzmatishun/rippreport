 Districts equal accountability! 

Sign the petition and turn in by this Friday to judge of probate! Word on the street is Fresh Start is STALE!
They are planning not to turn in their petitions, so council will stay at large. 
Time to FLUSH this "AT LARGE" council system! 

Don't let Catalyst "ZUNK" you!
