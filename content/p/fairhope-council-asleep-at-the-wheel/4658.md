 Mr. Ripp your claiming to be a Marine and a vet kudos if thats true. With that being said and all else aside. We do all have the right to our opinions if in fact you were a Marine  I do appreciate your service!! You have my respect as a fellow veteran. 

But I must say look out for election time because everything you think you accomplished will be turned back to the way it was before. The citizens are sick of what's been going on and many voters have wished they voted the other way now.
