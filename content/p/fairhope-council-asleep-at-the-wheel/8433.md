 The Parker Road traffic study will directly benefit Ripp who lives there.  Nothing wrong with this, but everyone needs to know this is a personal issue with Ripp and not some public service issue.  Using this blog for personal gain.  Again, nothing wrong with that but you need to know.

Please post or attach documents where Catalyst candidates/public officials have "sold this place out".  It is not true, and unless specific documents or votes are attached then it is not true.
