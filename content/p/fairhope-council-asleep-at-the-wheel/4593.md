 By your logic, if you live 3 feet from the Florida line and you are in Alabama, you are not taxed by Alabama? Either you live in Fairhope or you do not live in Fairhope. Pretty simple question and should be a pretty simple answer. If all of your children went to Fairhope schools, and your grandchildren go to Fairhope schools then you are the one the mayor condemns for not paying enough taxes, right? You use Fairhope assets but do not pay your share of taxes!
