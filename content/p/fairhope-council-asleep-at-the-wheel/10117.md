 No that post I can live with. BS is certainly what we can live without. Don’t forget, all of them are part of the P’s. Seems to me that several of Fairhope’s jobs require a college degree. Why wouldn’t it be a requirement for Mayor. Now a days, you definitely need someone with a degree AND experience to run a city like Fairhope!
