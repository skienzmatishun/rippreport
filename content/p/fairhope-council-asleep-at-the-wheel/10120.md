 I ran into Mahoney at the pier. I asked him about the BP spill and if he knew that the good senator Trip Pittmans anchors were still causing problems in mobile bay, and that they turn up all the time. I asked him if he knew each anchor weighed almost 60 pounds. I asked him if he knew kids had been hurt from running into them on skis and jet skis and that outboards frequently were ruined?

He was unaware.
I then asked him about his girlfriend, and if he'd picked an apartment downtown for after he was sworn in?

No answer.

The paddle board dude is a fraud.
Like bp and his matrimony.
