 Take a drive to foley.
They have a world class soccer facility.
It's one of the nicest in the entire South. In FOLEY they can hold prestigious events that draw thousands of competitors. These competitors and their families spend millions.

Take a drive to Fairhope. They have the lousiest soccer complexes in the county. It is an embarrassment to a community that considers itself forward thinking and certainly "better than foley".
Fairhope's soccer fields are not uo to standard. They are full of weeds and are not even. The fields cannot be considered for championship soccer tournaments. They are glorified practice fields with massive parking areas that no one will ever use.

Robert Jack and Kevin made a nice bundle on this scam.

Vote these guys out on Tuesday.

They suck as people and they are no fans of Fairhope or soccer. They care only about themselves.
