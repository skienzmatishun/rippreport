 Probably a school by the name of “East Fairhope High School.”
The growth will not stop until so many houses are built that the glut of houses will cause a crash in prices, a rise in crime, gridlocked traffic, and an increase in taxes.  
Then the developers who have funded the campaigns of the politicians will take their money and go off to another area to destroy
Fairhope’s days of a charming town are numbered.   It is too far gone.   This placed has been lid to ruins due to the developers and their puppet politicians
Ask a council member if they can say no to a new subdivision or a strip mall.  The politicians cannot because they are owned by Catalyst and Catalyst’s money come from the developers
Notice how the Catalyst group is silent?   They know what they are doing and they don’t care
