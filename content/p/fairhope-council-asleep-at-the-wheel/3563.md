 I did look at the campaign reports and the problem was.....we needed to get rid of some of those that got really comfortable in their present seats and the new ones running for office were very poor offerings so I voted against those in office.   No one with any lick of sense will run.  Have any suggestions as to how we can climb this mountain??
