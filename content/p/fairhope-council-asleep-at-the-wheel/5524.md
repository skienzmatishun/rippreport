 Criminal activity?  One public intox in 2005 that was not prosecuted, listed on a harassment, not pursued. Two sealed juvenile reports - idiots, his son has the same name he does. If it was a crime jack committed against a child, it would not be sealed, the victims name would not be given.  Truth teller,  you are lying. I've seen the actual reports, in full.  But this is what most of you all do, spread vicious lies and rumors about folks, with or without actual proof. Apples to apples, publish a copy of sweet Karin's police report.
