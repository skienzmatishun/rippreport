 What the Hell! Good news? for the first time in 10 years Fairhope is fully engaged in repairing sewer infrastructure. The utility dept does not pay the Mayor, as they did with Can't, and the utility fund is not used for lawsuits and balancing the budget. This is my 20th year "observing" Fairhope government and I you may not like this statement but it is a fact, Mayor Wilson has done more in 3 years than the previous administration did in 16 years. Oh let's not forget the rampant corruption
that existed. Mayor Wilson is not a good ole girl.
