 Keep in mind that expanding the business district and building height are the Mayor's plans. Rumor is that she has she staff working on selling the current city hall property to developers who would build a hotel and shopping village (city offices would move to K-1 school), build a convention center on the Dyas Triangle property, and construct a hotel and entertainment district at the Fairhope pier. That is part of her economic development plan. Might be a rumor, true. But, the mayor needs to come clean and either confirm or deny.
