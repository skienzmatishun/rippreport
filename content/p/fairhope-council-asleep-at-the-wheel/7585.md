 Ripp,
You said it correctly.  I personally know several people who work for the utilities here in Fairhope and I know how they literally cover up the sh*t. Several months ago a sewer pipe broke near the Grand Hotel Marina ans spewed raw sewage on a boat because it was under so much pressure. 
During a heavy rain, the operators at the plant are told to open the gates and flush the sewage into the bay.  It is "only" a $10,000 fine.
Ask any merchant downtown about the sewers in their stores.
The City wants to build storage tanks throughout the city to keep the raw sewage from overwhelming the plant.  
Robert Brown and the rest of the council lie through their teeth when they say the sewage plant is only 80% capacity.  With all the houses that  the Council lets their Catalyst developer donors build, the sewage plant is only getting more overwhelmed.
Eventually the Council will come out and say, "We need to expand the sewer plant and we have to go up on fees."  See? they will wait until Catalyst gets its houses built without having to pay impact fees and we, the residents, will have to pay for the growth.  This is and was Catalyst's main goal all along: TO BE ABLE TO BUILD ANYWHERE WITHOUT PAYING IMPACT FEES.  The Council, who is owned by Catalyst, do NOT represent the people.  They are puppets for the developers!  They are liars and they must be voted out.
