 Yes, thank you for pointing this out!  Sadly, we are stuck with the 3 B's blanketing their stupid church friends about what 'good Christians' they are.  Why are people here so stupid and blind as to what these frauds are doing to their property values?  It amazes me; Karin worked her butt off but she needs to either work with others or get off the ballot.  Manelos and Karin are competing for the votes of those who are tired of our CC and developers selling out our schools and city. It would be great if they would be Mayor/Vice Mayor and run Sullivan off before she can build more apartments for her buddies.  Her running for Mayor reminds me of when that coffee shop ran its dog for Mayor.  Nothing personal, but she can't even run a coffee shop, let alone a city.
