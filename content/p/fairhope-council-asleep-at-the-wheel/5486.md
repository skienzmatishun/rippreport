 It's hard to say what the public participation part of tonight's council meeting will be like.  Will it be a re-run of last Monday's scripted production?  Will Jack Burrell allow residents to speak as long as they want to and the audience to respond as ill-behaved brats, booing or clapping without interference from the Council President who has certainly interfered at other meetings when speakers said things he didn't approve of (or threaten them with handcuffs and jail if they uttered a word, depending entirely on who it was)?  Almost certainly one person will want to speak: Jessie Patterson, on whom a police report was filed yesterday because of threatening behavior toward the Mayor's family.  It's a fair guess he will be given time to say whatever he pleases, and more time if he wishes.  I expect tonight will be yet another embarrassment for Fairhope residents at the hands of the council.  

I support the Mayor and if anyone is removed from office it should be Jack Burrell.  Speak up if you feel the same way and if you can't or won't publicly (and who could blame you if not when surrounded by some of the crazy people we apparently now have in our city) at least show support for those who are willing to publicly support her.
