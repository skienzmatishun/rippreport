 Oh! you are so right and that brings up annexation, to bring those property's into the city limits. At the same time, or before, the city needs to go to districts and not a council at large that has no accountability. Want to know why I am not in the city? Because the former Mayor of Fairhope and the local good ole boys did not want the black community in the city limits. That is a fact Jack. To achieve that the city took the position not to annex anyone, that is why Fairhope has all these pockets of land that SHOULD be in the city. Another fact is that the only piece of property in Fairhope to be, legislatively, forced into the city limits was Wal Mart. That was after the former mayor lost about 8 million in taxes by not inviting Wal Mart in , once it was determined Fairhope could not stop Wal Mart location, the city's position at the time.Annexation and Districts will come up soon and watch the good ole boys and Catalyst push back on both.I look forward to both issues coming forward, being annexed, and represented by a specific representative. Then I can VOTE and your argument will be moot.
