 As usual you did not listen or attend the meeting. The Mayor was talking about all business in Fairhope she did point out the Downtown Merchants Association but made it clear she was talking about ALL business. You are wrong about not supporting candidates I supported this council, but they all ball faced lied about their affiliation with Catalyst and the fact that they were a block vote. Your complaints inspire me.
