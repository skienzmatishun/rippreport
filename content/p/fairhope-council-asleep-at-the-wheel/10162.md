 It’s a fact that John Oldshue is great friends with the 3 BBB’s. Especially with Jack Burrell. Talks to him in a pretty regular basis and Oldshue thinks Burrell hung the moon. By the way???? Where are either John Oldshue OR Jack Burrell from??? They for damn sure are not from around here!!!  Yet they pretend to have been born downtown and their families founded Fairhope. Be careful of these people. That’s why you have Jack Burrell speaking to women like they are lowlife dogs. Because the women and men of this town has let them.
