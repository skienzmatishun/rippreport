 This mayoral race might end in a run off between Karin and Sherry.
This will allow Catalyst to launch a full-on attack.  Hopefully this will be Catalyst's last stand.  But I am just doing wishful thinking....
Ripp, how do you walk down the street knowing that the Catalysts probably resent you for running so much opposition research against them?
