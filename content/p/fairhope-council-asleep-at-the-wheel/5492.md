 I just returned home from the meeting.  I have not attended one lately, preferring to watch online, and I was amazed at the complete rudeness and lack of any respect from primarily really old women.  They were talking out loud and making lewd comments constantly, making it difficult for some of us to hear the comments of those recognized by the Council to speak.   I have never seen people act this way........Walmart shopper cartoons on steroids!  When people make fun of Alabama, I now will know that they probably have met these characters! I noticed that at least one of them was sitting where the camera would catch her during most of the meeting!
Jessie Patterson appeared to lose the wind beneath his wings when he realized that most of the attendees supported Mayor Wilson. He actually seemed fairly harmless.   Mr. Cooper was great and I love the suggestion given by a gentleman whose name I don't recall that Jack Burrell cede the Presidency of the Council to Jay Robinson.  This was the best suggestion I have heard this year........please pass that one around and encourage all to support it.  That would be a great start to getting along and getting something done for this beautiful city!    Great comments by Kiefer Wilson!
Thanks to the Ripp Report for alerting the public of another planned lynching of the Mayor.
