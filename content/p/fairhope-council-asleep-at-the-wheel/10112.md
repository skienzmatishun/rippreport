 Well our little town needs to heal. It is time to cleanse our souls and forge a rebirth of leadership. I can feel the wave overcoming each of us. Karin is our best bet and a new council will actually work with her to help us control growth. God bless Karin and the brave people running against the crooked council taht steals contracts for themselves and families. Fairhope cannot afford to go backwards.
