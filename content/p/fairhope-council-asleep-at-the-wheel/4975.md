 So let me get this straight...three incumbents are NOT SEEKING RELECTION?
Okay. Fairhope y'all better wake up and start listening to Paul Ripp.
He is obviously onto something and I would wager BIG that there is some federal 
involvement or SOMETHING is going on us regular folks don't know about.
Burrell and Robinson are the future of Fairhope politics at this point. If that don't 
silt your britches you likely don't have a pulse folks.
