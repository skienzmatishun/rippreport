 Since we are getting off subject. This is completely true at the national level and true much of the time at the state level. Politicians receive too much in the way of perks and salary. How many jobs are there where a lot of people are spending money to get the job and fighting to keep,it.? You can pay these people a lot less and still get plenty of people wanting the job.  Why do so many want to be county commissioners ? That also kinda works for city employees. The only jobs that folks arenâ€™t hankering to get are the heavy equipment operators because a good operator can make lots more privately. The paper pusher jobs are all full. They get paid too much.
