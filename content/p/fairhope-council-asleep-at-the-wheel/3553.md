 These lawsuits and settlements are disturbing but also disturbing is what is coming up at Planning and Zoning on November 13, 2017.  2 items that should be a concern to all that try to use the downtown area.  One item coming up is increasing the business district. This will benefit developers and builders and they  will not have to provide parking for their development in the central business district.  Residents trying to find a parking place now will have a much harder time finding one if that occurs.  You need to read the write up in the October 20, 2017 issue of the Baldwin Times.  I forsee after reading this that part of our downtown area will be closed off to automobiles and accommodate walkers and cyclists and tourists and will Fairhope City then provide some kind of trolley service for tourists??  There are a lot of questions arising from reading this amendment. Also a public hearing on another item has to do with height of building.. PEOPLE WAKE UP!! Developers are taking over fast slipping in one item at a time till they have exactly what they want.
