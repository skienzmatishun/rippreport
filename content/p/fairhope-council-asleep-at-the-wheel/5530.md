 Jessie Patterson should start walking out into the bay and not stop. What a disgusting act while showing little or no evidence of a brain and some of the old stupid biddies that I watched especially the one in the black outfit sitting in the upper left corner of the video. She was not for anything good for Fairhope including when people mentioned “let’s all stop this mess and try to get along”  Then near the end, she got up to the microphone and to compliment Jack Burrell and the the City Council as he was asking for someone to spare her son’s life. Heck, that biddie is a prime example of what we don’t need in Fairhope. Her face appeared to not have smiled in a very, very long time. Either stand up and let’s all work together, no matter how many time we all have tried. It was obvious that she and Jack and the Council are not willing to give it another try. There can always be another attempt. This city is worth it. We all have made mistakes, no exceptions whatsoever. If you can’t have this attitude, then stay at home and most importantly, Shut the hell up. Enough of the finger pointing. Move on. There is little trust from ALL SIDES, but is still a need for a cease fire and give it another shot. Some of you biddies, I know you are old and may not know all the facts, but quit drinking the cool aid and making a fool of yourselves to everyone watching around Fairhope and the rest of the world.
