 FYI, I don't watch tv and I am 'out &amp; about' more than not when I am here.   I haven't heard anyone other than 'Sherry's  junior high school fangirls' saying anything negative about Manelos.  Because you remain 'Anonymous', you can hide your identity but  those who have seen your post are aware that you also are not well educated or clued-in to current events. The conversations that I hear are that voters are torn between Karin &amp; John.  Perhaps you are the one who should 'get out and about'! LOL!  If Sherry Sullivan wins, I hope that she will work for the citizens of Fairhope and not for those developers that are said to be financing her.
