 So sad. Fairhope back in 2000 was a really nice place. Moved away in 2001 after two years there with my family. We moved back in 2012 after a decade in D.C. The things I've seen in the past six years have broken my heart. The Fairhope government is self-serving. The city council is feathering their nests and it is easy to see. Robert Brown "your hometown" is the worst. Gets a half million dollar contract? WTF? Why is everyone so dumb in Fairhope now? Why is this allowed?
