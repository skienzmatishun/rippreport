 This is something that could go either way. It is about $. A full time attorney WHO WOULD  TAKE THE JOB will probably not be an expert in many areas. So do you save litigation expense with them ? Of course a cheaper route would be for EVERYONE to behave so there were fewer potential suits..  I do not subscribe to the Mayor's premise that a full time attorney is obviously better. It seems whenever something does not gomher way she claims she is a victim.  I predict 3 years from now you will see a majority of the Council decide not to run for reelection and that the Mayor will dominate the agenda. Not so confident that she will do a good job. Seems to have a problem keeping down spending.
