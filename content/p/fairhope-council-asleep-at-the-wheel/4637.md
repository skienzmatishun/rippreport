 Anyone that believes the Council or Mayor alone is entirely at fault for the pathetic leadership of this city simply is biased and has no real interest in holding the entire city administration (Mayor &amp; Council) accountable for the exigent issues facing this city. The mayor and council are good people and are taking actions they believe are in the best interest of the city. They have all made poor and inexcusable decisions, but none are corrupt as some would suggest. Overall, they (The Six) have miserable failed to deliver any meaningful leadership.  Both are at fault. The only hope for the remainder of this term is for the people of this city to abandon the blatant and unabashed partisanship and hold all of these officials responsible. On the current topic, the Dyas Triangle, it should be designated for public parklands, not commercialized and developed.
