 Sherry has a lot of people fooled. You people that may attend church with here or are friends of her Certainly  cannot be as blind or stupid as you are seemingly being. Sherry Sullivan is a disappointing and a very untrustworthy person especially when she is an employee of someone. They only reason she wasn’t fired in the first place is that out previous Mayor Tim was hanging all over her and actually walking around downtown all times of the nights without one care. We can already see with her track record that she cannot hold on to a job. If you truly know Sherry Sullivan and you are thinking about voting for her. At least asked why she has had several jobs during just the past 3 or 4 years. Doesn’t make sense for anyone with this track record being MAYOR OF FAIRHOPE. The biggest mistake that Mayor Wilson made was not firing Sherry Sullivan the first freakin day she took office. But, she was actually giving Sherry a chance even though she knew that Sherry was a worthless employee and each time she has been employed since being fired and after suing the city, she is absolutely a terrible business person and by no means has the least bit of any qualifications to run the city of Fairhope. True that!!!
