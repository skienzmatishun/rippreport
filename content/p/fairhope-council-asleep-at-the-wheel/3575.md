 With all these sexual harassment allegations going on. You won't see Fiddler accusing Tim Kant of anything like that. All the love stuff that went on between them two were sickening. Fiddler should not get a dime as she what paid twice as much as she earned for many many years. As I see it. She might owe the city some money. She was fired fair and square. The only thing Mayor Wilson is guilty of is trying to be fair and letting these 3 goofballs stay on and giving them a chance. These 3 women in question have used our city for nothing but their own gain. The proper thing the Mayor should have done was to give them their pink slips after being sworn in. These 3 women are a disgrace to the City of Fairhope. Overpaid and did everything they could do to hurt the City of Fairhope as they continue to do so. It is a fact that Jack Burrell and other councilmen discussed how they were going to get money from the city well before anyone of them filed a lawsuit. Jack Burrell can't and won't deny this. Too many people knew that he had conversations with the 3 fired employees on how to get the most money from the lawsuits before they even filed. Don't be surprised, this is how Jack Burrell thinks that business is done.
