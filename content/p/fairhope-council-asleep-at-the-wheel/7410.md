 Oh don’t worry Chris some of us will run for office.  We know we will be up against Catalyst but the word is out that Catalyst can be beaten despite their moneyed backers 
What’s more Catalyst candidates are being exposed and shamed by the public for them selling out to the money, developers, and the cabal that make up Catalyst.
Rest assured, Dorsey, Kant, and several other Catalyst candidates are living proof that people are learning about how Catalyst.   This next election will be a repudiation for this current council.   Boone, Burrell, and Brown, you are on notice.
