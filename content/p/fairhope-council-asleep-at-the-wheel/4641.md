 You can be sure we will watch and investigate anything going on at Jack Burrell Airport. Burrell has represented the Airport, before the city interests. He has fought tooth and nail to maintain control of the Airport Board and keep the city at a arms length away. The 1% at the Airport
 have Jack in their pocket. His involvement in the Airport scandal is not over.
You don't know Jack, better watch him very close, especially when it comes to the Airport.
