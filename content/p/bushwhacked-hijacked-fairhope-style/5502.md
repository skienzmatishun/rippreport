 Tell us what you know about these real estate PACS? I think they have dipped their toes in my direction as well. 
 Top councilmen and the exmayor  have sent some of the areas finest REALTORS into my house and on my property with “fake” clients only to offer a lowball offers and negotiations for the parcels they desire, It is unethical and an invasion of privacy. But I hold on to voice activated recordings. Some realtors &amp; politicians might wish they had never participated in this. 
We know exactly who you are.
