 Hey NAACP. Who called you so quickly to come to this meeting. You must be stupid not to see this was a set up by the racist group of The Council and it’s warts.  This was a black man being set up all the white people to watch. Before I got up and spoke on a matter that you certainly did not have all the facts on, I would have a little more research. It was the people who used your fellow brother as a puppet for all the white stupid ass people of Fairhope to cheer and show their stupidity. Why would the Cheif drive all the way up to Montgomery, fill out his retirement papers and then when Montgomery said they will send them off. The Cheif said “hold on to them for a while”. Was he screwing with us???  Something smells awful fishy with this decision. Why drive all the way to Montgomery and then tell them to hold on to them and not send them forward. DID he take a vacation day for this? DID he drive a city vehicle?  You can email or send them Fedex or UPS or mail them. Hope you didn’t prank us and screw us at the same time all because of Jackass Burrell and the MOFO city council and especially the stupid ass people who were fired.   Dammit!  Who’s screwing who here!!!! Get real all of you, especially you NAACP WHO WAS PLAYED LIKE A FOOL RIGHT ALONG WITH THE CHIEF!
