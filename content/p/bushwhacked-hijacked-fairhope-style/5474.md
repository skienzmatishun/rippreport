 Facebook is covered up with attacks on the Mayor.  These people for the most part would never act the way they are or say the things they're saying if they weren't behind a computer screen.  For the first time I am embarrassed to say I live in Fairhope.  I wish those who do would stop and think how they are making us ALL appear.  It's embarrassing and though they may feel they're speaking up for a poor, mistreated employee (Petties) what they are actually doing is making unsubstantiated vocal determinations based on only hearing one side of a story.  I would imagine those very people when trying to teach their children well would always advise them against doing such a thing.  And they they grow up and do it themselves.

The behavior of the vocal minority at the last Council meeting was disgraceful.  The clapping and booing and outbursts from the audience was shameful and it was only made worse by the fact that Burrell allowed it to happen.  This is obviously a man with two different books for what is allowed during an open meeting, and he is perfectly okay with using one for the people he agrees with and another for those he doesn't.  This is a man who has no business sitting on a City Council.
