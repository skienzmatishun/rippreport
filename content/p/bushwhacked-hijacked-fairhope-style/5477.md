 I so hope that those of you who are disgusted by the charade put on by the council, sherry and the chief will attend the city council meeting tonight in support of Mayor Wilson.  Our small town is at a turning point under Mayor Wilson.  It's up to us... the people of Fairhope to stand up, be seen, be counted and ultimately be heard that we will not stand for a council that lines it's own pockets with deals bad for our town; we will not stand for a police chief (regardless of gender or race) who cries "bully" instead of charging the stand for what is right; we will not stand for men in power to bully an empowered woman like Mayor Wilson.  Speaking of bullying did you hear Jesse Patterson went into the Mayors stored and threatened to return with 300 people chanting for her resignation... shouldn't he just stay focused on his own legal battles of alleged embezzlement from the Organic School?
I hope to see you all there tonight.  The Kant and council supporters are rallying their people and will be there.  We don't need to be loud or obnoxious (they have this covered), we just need to be there.  I'm tired of the council and these former city employees making a mockery of our town.  It's time to get down to business and sweep out the dirt starting with the council.
