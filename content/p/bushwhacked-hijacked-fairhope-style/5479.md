 I was shopping in the Page &amp; Palette yesterday when someone I now know was Jessie Patterson came in.  Evidently he had tried to see the Mayor but failing that decided to confront her husband who was working.  He acted in a very aggressive and threatening manner to such a degree that an incident report had to be filed with the police department.  I have since learned that this man has some type of mental condition for which he is being treated and apparently was "off his meds".  I recognize his name because he is the person who has had a long-term hard-on against Mayor Wilson and who started the petition to impeach her.

This behavior is what happens when normal people (i.e. Fairhope residents) get whipped into a feeding frenzy by other people like the formerly-fired employees and friends of friends of friends of Chief Petties.

If things continue to go in the same direction, there is no telling where this situation might end...but if it ends in violence, look to your neighbors for causing it.
