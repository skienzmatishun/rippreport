 You only wish it could be blamed on him!  No one would spend as much time as he does  VOLUNTEERING to fight corruption - for what?  He's not a politician, he doesn't sell ads, he is not a political paid analyst. People against him don't know what to do with him so they try to make him out to be crazy. But guess what? He loves Fairhope, fights for women and children in our corrupt Baldwin County legal system with things you'll never see in the news or on this blog, and the only agenda he has is weeding out corruption.  Been fighting it his whole life and his dad before him. 

I just watched the John McAfee documentary today and he was even in this fighting the corruption in Belize! He could have been killed for that! Good job Paul!  Not afraid and always stands up for what is right.  

The people hijacking Fairhope are JACK and COUNCIL! Why are they doing what they're doing?? 
Personal gain. They had not platform or vision except to block our mayor. 
And former disgruntled  employees  who  need to MOVE on!!!  Because we the citizens see the City is moving forward.
