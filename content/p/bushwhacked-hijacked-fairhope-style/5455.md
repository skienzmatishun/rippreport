 Anonmyass, we will see. I can assure you, and I haven’t been wrong for the last 20 years on an election call, so whatever the very next political position Jack Burrell runs for next? I guarantee you that he will not win.  If you should want to put your money where your mouth of so many pathetic and dirty words are coming from. I have a way with any attorney of your choice to wager you $5000 Once you pick an attorney and put up the $5000 up. I’ll have my attorney put up mine with a contract that we both can agree on. If you are not interested, the very least you can do is watch you filthy mouth and act like a decent human being! Trip Pittman made me a lot of money and I even took additional bets that he would get less than 10% of the State’s Votes. So everyone that reads or posts on this site and sees the filthy and nasty posts  made over and over by you “ANONMYASS”. The offer has been made. ANONMYASS, “Put up or Shut Up”!  If you care to place a bet now. I’ll wager $5000  that Underwood will beat Dorsey. Because the filthy words that you use in your posts and you being a Jack Burrell fan, you  must be a Tucker Dorsey fan too!
