 Well i did confirm Jack's unconstitutional free speech denial rampage case IS going to federal court. I presume Burrell's ego was the main reason. People likely don't understand but if Ripp bribgs in con law experts it could go seven figures with the payout and legal and court costs. Who is the insurance company for the city? If I were them I would reign in Marcus and get a real attorney--or they are gonna get burned bad. There's no way a jury sides with Burrell after his record is brought up in deposition and trial before the jurors.
