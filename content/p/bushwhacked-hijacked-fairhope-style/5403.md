 Agree with WOW &amp; GEORGIA!! 
Ridiculous that the NAACP was there!!
This was a set up.
The chief bullied! Please!  Who wants a chief of police That is willing to go along with a circus show and not keep order. His wife making nasty comments about the mayor. It's a disgrace  and a poor representation of a chief/leader and his spouse. The police department needs an overhaul. Buying so called used computers and then losing them. ..... 
Investigators not following up with citizens after multiple contacts . Officers/Chief Do what the good  ole boys" tell them. This town is growing way too fast. This department  needs the best and not share their political views. 
All these fired people are mad bc they had someone actually supervise them. When Kant was in office it was a free for all... ..that's why Fairhope is in deep shit... Literally. 
I would think that the retired ones would be grateful to the mayor. She could've cleaned house on day one. 
With all this DRAMA...... Build a performing arts theatre and act it out there. Spare the citizens this ridiculous side show. Council &amp; Mayor get to business ... Keep moving forward. 
iTs in the PIPELINE................
