 Gravity sewer? Are you delusional? Shit doesnâ€™t run uphill, so in order to get it to where it needs to be, in some areas it will be 20 maybe 30 feet deep. Now, take into consideration, if the bottom is twenty feet, then the sides, according to code have to be 3:1 slopes back. Which means 60 feet each side. Do you realize what that will cost, not to mention destroy? Or you could bore it, that shit is real cheap. The only shit that runs uphill around here comes from Ripps mouth
