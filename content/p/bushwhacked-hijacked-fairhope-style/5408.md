 Every rediculous accussation against the mayor is what Burrell, himself, is guilty of!  He's been arrested for harrassement - mulitiple times!  He uses his position for personal gain! He bullies Mayor Wilson every chance he gets. He's a male shovinest pig! Anyone who supports him and his behavior should be ashamed of themselves. 

Sherry Sullivan and Jennifer Fidler treated employees horribly just like Kant. 

All the conflict our city has been facing are from hateful, vindictive people like Burrell.  He doesn't care about Fairhope! He only cares about power!
