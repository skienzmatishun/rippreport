 You can definitely tell who the smart people are on this page, and who are the crazy uninformed ones.  The smart people make intelligent comments based on the subject and the stupid ones call the other posters names while adding nothing worthwhile to the conversation.  The latter just fills up this page with wah-wah-wah-wah that nobody wants to wade through to get to the comments with substance.  I believe that Mr. Ripp should start deleting all comments that either don't pertain to this particular blog or are nothing but name-calling rants against other posters.  Children should be treated like children and when they can't behave around the adults, send them to their rooms.  Personally I'm all for reading opinions that don't line up with mine but the useless drivel by some who apparently only post because they like mindless aggression toward others is tiring and frankly, doesn't belong here.
