 I lost fifteen pounds due to a clear conscious.   I will run for City Council and will not be a Catalist. Do I have a chance?   Let me know before I throw my hat in...
Your response will be an indication of whether I run or not.    I will not take contributions from Corte or any real estate PACS.   I will take up to $1,000 from individuals for printing,qualification fees, and meet and greets. After that I  will run on my name. Any other contributions will be refused and returned.   
My platform will be controlled growth, no pump grinders, zoning, and moratoriums on subdivisions.
