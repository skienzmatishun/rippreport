 Dear Bay Gazer,
You have been gazing at the stars too long and have become blinded by the stars or perhaps mesmerized by the fiddling. 
There are more corrupt cover ups than Jacks. 
Do you not understand what “putting your hand in a cookie jar” means, and having it covered up!?!!!!
Of course not! You are naive and can not read or understand like half of Fairhope. 
You believe everything you are told.
