 Et tu, Brute
What a fabulous production I saw the other night! Encore! Encore! 

The most DISTURBING thing of all was what I witnessed following that special meeting, The biased newspaper boy, some City Councilmen and their wives, ExMayor Kant and his wife, Karla, and other ex Department Heads joined each other and were high fiving, fist bumping, drinking and celebrating and laughing about what had just been done to Mayor Wilson.

I felt so ashamed that these people were so disrespectful and cruel and in power over my sweet Fairhope. Shame on all of you! They should hang their heads in shame and step down.

I have been upset about this for days.

We should start a petition to impeach them.
