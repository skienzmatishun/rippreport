 I heard Ripp's lawsuit is going to federal court.

This is bad news. Federal court is expensive and I do not see a jury siding with Fairhope in a videotaped account of the actual deprivation of free speech under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

Also how is it that the city attorney is representing both he and Jack? Is there not a conflict? Does anyone realize just how stupid Jack Burrell is? Police record aside.
