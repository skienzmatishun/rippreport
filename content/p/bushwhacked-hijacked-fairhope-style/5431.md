 Councilman Kevin Boone helped create Catalyst, had to get out due to conflict and now his son, Scott, runs!!

Councilman Jimmy Conyers (tapped to run) is best friends with Scott and used catalyst. 

Of course Kant and he lost to Mayor Wilson (their first loss but many more will follow now that Ripp has been reporting the truth)

Councilman Jay Robinson - tapped to run, was on planning, voted for the fly creek apts and voted again to approve extension on their zoning this term. 

Not sure if councilman Jack Burrell used because he really didn't have competition 

No one can figure out councilman Robert Brown. I doubt he used catalyst but he's 100% in now.  A developer, fought the moratorium and the city enforcing the cheap sewer infrastructure he and his partner Cliff Pitman have been installing which really has been screwing new homeowners  for a long time.  Our Mayor is now enforcing gravity fed sewer to protect citizens from greedy developers!!
