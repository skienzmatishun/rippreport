 Chief has sat in the back of council chambers for over a year and watched Jack-ass and many others "bully" the mayor and do absolutely nothing.  And now he has the audacity to call her a bully after receiving an unfavorable review? I'm happy the mayor won't settle for the status quo - if this was a man it wouldn't have happened. 

All this was orchistrated. Chief may have been considered a "nice" and "respectable" man before but he has lost all respect and credibility now. Now he will be remembered for this. It's sad and disgracefull. 

Jack-ass and good ol boys Tut and Marcus city attorneys know chief and police Dept can't report to them. A council who can't even do their own damn job much less take over the mayor's.

People are watching and they're disgusted.
