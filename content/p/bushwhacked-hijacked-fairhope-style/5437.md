 Support the Mayor?  She’s an embarrassment, she can’t even speak in complete sentences at a meeting.  The Chief wasn’t being used, he’s tired of answering to someone who is completely incompetent.  I’m not pro city  council but she’s wrong on this one. There would have been standing room only if enough people even knew about the meeting in the first place and they wouldn’t be standing with her.  She’ll lose in a landslide if she’s ignorant enough to run again.
