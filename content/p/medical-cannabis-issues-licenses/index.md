Alabama Issues Three Medical Cannabis Dispensary Licenses and Approves Five Certifying Physicians
Montgomery, Ala. — Alabama’s medical cannabis program reached another operational milestone this week as state regulators issued three new medical cannabis dispensary licenses and approved five physicians to certify patients for participation in the program.

The announcements mark continued progress in the implementation of the Darren Wesley “Ato” Hall Compassion Act, which legalized medical cannabis in Alabama and placed oversight authority with the Alabama Medical Cannabis Commission (AMCC).

New Dispensary Licenses

The AMCC confirmed that three medical cannabis dispensary licenses have been awarded, expanding the number of locations authorized to dispense medical cannabis products to qualified patients across the state. Licensed dispensaries are permitted to sell approved medical cannabis products, including tablets, gels, oils, creams, and other non-smokable forms authorized under Alabama law.
State officials emphasized that dispensaries must meet strict regulatory requirements, including product tracking, security protocols, and patient verification procedures, before becoming fully operational.

Five Physicians Approved to Certify Patients

In addition to the dispensary licenses, the Alabama Board of Medical Examiners & Medical Licensure Commission approved five physicians to certify patients for medical cannabis use. Under Alabama law, only physicians who meet statutory training and registration requirements may recommend medical cannabis for qualifying medical conditions.
Approved physicians are authorized to certify patients with conditions such as chronic pain, PTSD, cancer-related symptoms, epilepsy, Crohn’s disease, and other conditions specified in statute and AMCC rules.

Program Implementation Continues

While licenses have been issued, regulators caution that full statewide access will occur in phases. Dispensaries must complete final inspections, inventory approvals, and seed-to-sale tracking integration before opening to patients.
The AMCC has stated that additional licensing actions and regulatory updates are expected in the coming months as the program transitions from development to full operation.
Alabama remains one of the more tightly regulated medical cannabis programs in the country, with prohibitions on smokable products and a strong emphasis on physician oversight and patient safety.
