The Podcast is the court of public opinion. We discuss topics ranging from human interest stories to political corruption.

The podcast is not shy about calling out corrupt politicians, Judges or Attorneys.

Political posts are posted at our discretion, we do not solicit paid political ads, we are a consumer organization, non profit. We are not attorneys and can give no legal advise, however we can, at no charge, help you find legal representation, if necessary.
