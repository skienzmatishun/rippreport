 i wiil write a special report on Boom Boom Pittman and his theft of BP money and leaving anchors in the bay from his misuse of BP funds. A tractor company with no contractor's licence no marine insurance or marine experience, the appointed trustee for the bp funds takes $750,000 for himself. Fine Christian man my ass.
