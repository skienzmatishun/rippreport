 WELL JESTER!  IF YOU REALLY WERE NOT BROWN. WHY ARE YOU GETTING SO UPSET AND DEFENSIVE.  I WOULD THINK THAT IF YOU WERE TRULY NOT ROBERT BROWN. YOU WOULD NOT BE MAKING ANY EXCUSES AT ALL AND TELLING EVERYONE THEY ARE WRONG AND EVEN SAYING MAYBE YOU ARE ONE OF THE MANY OTHER PEOPLE THAT YOU MENTIONED. YOU THINK WE DONT ALREADY KNOW! MR. BROWN. JESTER WOULD HAVE HAD NO REASON TO GET FRAZZLED, DEFENSIVE, UPSET AND MAKING UP OTHER PEOPLE OTHER THAN YOURSELF. BINGO!  THANK YOU FOR ADMITTING IT ROBERT BROWN.
