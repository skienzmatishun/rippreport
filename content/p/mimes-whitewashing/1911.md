 No one has my back, I fly totally solo.  "....Boone and Brown need to start doing their jobs and stop blowing hot air and challenging the mayor to sue the city when they are responsible for obstructing the mayor from doing her job..." Boone nor Brown challenged the mayor to sue the city, she threated to sue the city if they didn't vote for what she wanted. They all voted NO to her request to obtain an attorney! The council has a legal right to vote how they feel is best for the city. Your statement is not correct, it is wrong, totally wrong! Now, put your money where your mouth is! 

You don't know Jack!
