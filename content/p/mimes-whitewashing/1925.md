 There is no way that Jester is a woman and here's why: Because he attacks women personally.  Only a man would criticize the mayor and other women for their appearance, they way they dress, and their businesses and interests that do not relate to politics in any way.  Men who are threatened by strong women fight back with verbal personal assault instead of intelligent discord.  Mark my words: when it comes out who Jester is, we will find it's a man.  A mean-spirited, misogynistic man who is very likely ball-busted at home.
