 Who are the people behind the FRIENDS of FLY CREEK lawsuit? 

Are they friends with Jack? 

Why would the city accept the deed from Corte?
Is it the past law firm (Hand Arendall), along with the city attorney that thought this was a good idea? Right after Hand Arendall represented Robert Berglin in a threatened lawsuit to the Sandy Ford neighborhood. 

Talk about unclear and confusing!!
