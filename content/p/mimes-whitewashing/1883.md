 Jester doesn't troll, I peep! Jester post when I see just how pitiful of a job this queen is doing. She hired this high paid community and economic development director and someone from Gulf Shores lands this high profile Auburn University Educational Complex. WOW! It will also serve as an incubator for entrepreneurs that Botox was 'talking' about! Talk, talk, talk, talk that is all this mayor and her buddies do. That complex would have been perfect for Fairhope! The sooner the mayor resigns, then a special election can be held so we can elect a real leader. 

AND maybe I am on the cities time? Maybe I in the mayor's bookstore drinking coffee listening to all the lies? Maybe, maybe and maybe! 

Strike Fast! Strike Hard!
