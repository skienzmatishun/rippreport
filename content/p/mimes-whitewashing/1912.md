 Wait, did I read this correct, Ripp is calling Jester opinionated? Where do you want me to start about the queen's agenda? Her agenda is to further herself within politics, she attends all of these conferences when she should be focused on getting the strategic plan finished, when she was elected she stated she already had a strategic plan but now, well! She is out for herself!  I have not used any bigoted remarks, nor sexist, and speaking of bullying, oh my word, all you do Ripp and the queen do is threaten people, Ripp you call them names! If me calling someone is acting like a little girl is not different than someone saying they are acting like a little boy, you read what you want to read Ripp. Sexist, not once have I been sexist, and if this was a male mayor then I would call him the king.
