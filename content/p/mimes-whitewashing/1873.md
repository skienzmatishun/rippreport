 Most people in Fairhope appear to agree with the Council's decision not to hire another attorney.  Why should the taxpayers pay for yet another attorney (particularly one hired to sue us)?  The Mayor needs to talk to the current City Attorney and go from there.
Nothing is being accomplished by the Mayor or the Council because she is acting like she owns Fairhope; she should remember her campaign promises, fire her 'paid lackeys', and get to work on the Comprehensive Plan and getting rid of the Fly Creek Apartments.  Her showboating is becoming tiresome even to those of us who supported her.
