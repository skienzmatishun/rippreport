 I just merely stated, "maybe we could have gotten something like this in Fairhope!" This shows how just how paranoid this blog! Keep guessing, one day you will figure who Jester is, I see and speak to some of you often. I use to be a mayor supporter, and now! Maybe I am just a double-agent? Maybe I work at the city hall? Maybe I am the homeless woman at the library? Maybe I am buried at Colony Cemetery? Maybe I am a figment of your imagination! Maybe I am your conscious and you can not handle the truth?
