 Doesn't matter ignorant one. Don't blame the Auburn thing on the Mayor Wilson or her staff. Keep showing your ignorance. You amuse me and I'm sure others as well.  Seems like all of you want to just blame the Mayor for everything. You all alway have excuses and take no blame for anything. You think that the Fairhope Council has never done anything wrong? There will be legal consequences for all of you and your fellow Councilmen. I'd tell you and your buddies to grow up. But that's a FACT that will never happen. Throwing rocks while living in glass houses. Y'all keep it up. Enjoying the show.
