 I agree completely.  I don't always agree with the Mayor's decisions, but I always believe that her decisions are made from a position of wanting the best for Fairhope.  If I were her, I would have been hounded to suicide, but she has stood strong in her beliefs that she is doing the best thing for the City and I am behind her 100%.  Some people on the City Council have been shameless in their attempts to destroy both her and the City.
