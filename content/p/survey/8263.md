 Why does this council get away with so much graft?  It is either because maybe they ARE operating within the law, or the connections they have shield them from impunity.
Why is not the Ethics Commission or the Attorney General not doing anything? Maybe the council is in fact acting in a legal way. 
Anyone's thoughts????
