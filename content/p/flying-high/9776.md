 Lopez,
Even though you were asking Ripp, I am going to step out of my lane and answer why Catalysts call him a "REMFSTER."
First, "REMSTER" stands for "Rear Echelon M*th*r F*CK*R."  This refers to a US Marine who served in the Marines but only in a support role, never saw action, yet uses the Marines as a prop.
From what I know of Ripp, Ripp saw combat and was injured while serving in combat.  He is not a REMF by any sense.  You can see this by his fierceness and fearlessness.  Ripp has been in far more dangerous situations than having Catalysts threaten to sue him, throw him in jail. Most of the Catalyst leadership have never served in the military and think that if they come across as bullies, they will appear tough to others.  Ripp stands up to them and sees them for what they are: spoiled college frat boys that have never grown up and think they can treat women like they did in college.
I have met Ripp several times and I see him exude toughness and humility at the same time.  he is much better being a friend than an opponent.
Ripp's detractors can only call him this becuase Ripp tells the truth and the Catalysts cannot call him a liar because Ripp speaks the truth
