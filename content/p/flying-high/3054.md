 While Burrell was a bully, as usual, I don't think it's fair to turn against Chief Pettus.  He has to do what he's instructed during a council meeting - which as we've all been told time and time again by Burrell is HIS meeting, he makes the rules, and everybody else there is there or opens their mouth at his discretion.  I swear to God, Burrell's power-hunger has driven him completely insane.
