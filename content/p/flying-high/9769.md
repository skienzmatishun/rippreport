 Break with the past and the path of Kant/Wilson competition. Vote/elect John Manelos. Great qualifications for Mayor. Platform: Keep the Fairhope Pier Rose Garden &amp; American Flag as is and improve bulkheads. Fast track sewage/rain water infrastructure to create a healthy Fairhope beaches and Mobile Bay. Common sense approach to budgets, administration and relationship to Council.
