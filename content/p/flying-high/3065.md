 You sure you went to the Fairhope Council Meeting? There was extensive discussion about the Sewer report and the need to address the infrastructure. Mayor Wilson advocated the questionable idea of voiding honest bids for the City health insurance business ostensibly to get a better price.  Thought the Mayor displayed a surprisingly unethical attitude, very blatant. No wonder companies are starting to avoid doing business with the City.  The staff is doing an excellent job of attacking the infrastructure weaknesses. I give her credit for assembling them. It is going to take 20 million for the upgrades and new treatment plant. Add a few million for electrical and this city better get ready to spend some serious $
