 Did not attend last night's City Council Meeting but watched the video.  Burrell is now cutting off our freedom of speech? He lost it at the end last night.  Burrell requesting Police Chief Pettus to remove Paul Ripp from the room and the Chief doing so turned me against Chief Pettus. Burrell needs to go now!  Someone needs to check him into a facility to get some help and learn some control. He should not be on the loose.  So he is taking our privileges away???  What about our rights???  I say We Take Him Away...in a straight jacket!!
