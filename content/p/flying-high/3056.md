 Georgia, you are so right about so much.  I am hoping (please dear God) that even though most of us have no idea what's going on behind the scenes as far as the investigations that are ongoing, that doesn't mean that inroads are not being made that will change things in the future.  It's no secret to any of us that investigations are not sprints but long distance races.  It's a real shame that what I truly think we will one day learn is taking so long to come to light.  But I still have faith it will, and I'm just trying to be patient until it does.  But I'll tell you one thing, Jack Burrell is working my very last nerve.
