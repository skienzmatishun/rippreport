This is the same old obstruction process Burrell has been pushing since Tim Kant lost.

The Fairhope City Council has been a disaster and is the most corrupt in recent memory. The silent council members are equally guilty by remaining silent and putting friends before their elected office.

supports Mr Burrell’s financial committee, why won’t he? He sure has enjoyed the fruits of elected office. Jack taught Brown everything he knows about how to control bid committees and how to secure a contract, while being an elected official.

The City Council in Fairhope accomplished very little in the first year, other than obstruct the Mayor. Last year a major obstruction went on for three months, the city budget. It clearly is the responsibility of the council to approve the budget. For three months the Mayor extended an olive branch to the council in an effort to get an approved budget. The council members have been absent for meetings and spent very little effort to approve a budget. The council has offered lame excuses or asked mundane questions that have done little to resolving the issue.

The City Budget is the responsibility of the Mayor. Mr. Burell, with the assistance of the council set up a hand picked financial committee, who he wants to assume the duties of preparing the budget. Mr. Chuck Zunk, formally from the infamous Airport Board was recruited to “head” the committee, and to carry Burrell’s water, again. You do remember the Fairhope Airport and Mr Burrell’s one man bid committee?

## YOU DON’T KNOW JACK

I have followed four Fairhope city councils and one thing I can tell you is with each new council several things became abundantly clear. The new members of the council are usually influenced by…

The Mayor prepares a budget, and it takes the council over 4 months to approve it and now the council wants to appoint a Jack Burrell finance committee, that wishes the Mayor step aside and let them do the budget. Clearly the boys are flying high.

The finance committee is a farce just like the Airport. An honest and reliable finance committee would insist that the Fairhope Airport, purchased and financed by tax dollars, title, be in the City’s name, not the Airport Authority.

Go fly a plane Chuck and take Jack with you he loves free plane rides.

Wake up Fairhope it is time for Jack and Brown to step down.

The stink around the Airport is not the sewer, or geese.
