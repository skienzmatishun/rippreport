 Fedora,I hate reading these long posts too. Yours post wasn't a so called sort one itself. But maybe everyone is getting the point again. We need to start getting the point and show up with facts without letting the momentum slow. How we do this I don't know. I've tried the facts and actually brought fellow  citizens to the Council meetings. We have got to act now or we will be kicking ourselves in the rear saying the same ole thing in 6 months again.  I don't care if people are pro Council or pro mayor. We need to fix this together. The ones who are guilty and could careless about Fairhope will stick out like a sore thumb and we can all be taking notes of who they are!
