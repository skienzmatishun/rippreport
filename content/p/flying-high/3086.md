 1. No need to name call even if you don't like my post.
2. I know of several companies who have stopped or hesitated to do business with Fairhope. There are multiple reasons but manipulating the bid process would not help. I still say it is unethical in the manner suggested at the meeting. I know she is trying to save $ but not this way.
3. Agreed it's good to shop price, but that avoids addressing the process that the Mayor was trying to subvert. She talked around it but I was left with the impression she would have accepted the second bid. 
4. You imply Burrell is showing favoritism. If that is the case then
He would be part of the problem. If there is a black and white case where a low bidder did not get a bid but followed the process then
that should be exposed. The Airport hangar scandal was not apples and apples. The winner was to build a much nicer hangar
which reverts to the city at lease end. That offset a slight difference
In expected revenue.
