 I looked up the specifics of what an impact fee is.  This is the common definition: 


The fee is meant to offset the financial and usage impact of the new development on the area's public infrastructure.


The public infrastructure is meant to include roads, schools, parks, recreational facilities, and wastewater facilities, among others.


Ok now I am really confused.
