 Georgia, I think a LOT of citizens would more than back you 100% !!!  We need to go for it - the time is NOW - we need to STOP fooling with the LOCAL, COUNTY &amp; STATE politicians &amp; local news who is AFRAID to tell the TRUE side of what has been going on!!   Do it NOW - let the Country know about the corruption that has gone on for YEARS in this beautiful town  by previous MAYORS &amp; now Burrell, Boone &amp; the new council - they all need to be let go.  I am more than SICK of Cortes, &amp; other land owners in Baldwin County (who gave Kant money personally ???). It was another poor pitiful farmer &amp; landowner in Baldwin County!  They use MONEY to get exactly what they want &amp; for politicians &amp; Attorneys in Baldwin County to SIDE with them!  Take it National for the whole country to see!!!
