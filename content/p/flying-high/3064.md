 I had forgotten that Jack Burrell claimed that he put in the cameras; thanks for the reminder! 
He probably wanted the cameras to capture for posterity his 'good looks, charming demeanor, bespoke wardrobe, presidential command of his audience, etc'.  
However, the cameras captured a bully terrified of losing his power. I don't know Burrell, but I think that Karin's win in the election has turned him into a monster.  There must be big deep secrets to hide because normal intelligent people do not  become completely unhinged unless they think that they are headed for Atmore.

Beyond sad.  Burrell will destroy the city......a robot in a suit.
