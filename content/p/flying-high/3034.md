 Ya better tell everyone again because about 3/4 of the citizens of Fairhope are just plain ignorant or don't give 2 cents because they are either too old to give a crap or they don't care about our environment and what terrible conservation affects this project will have on God's very own Fly Creek. Just wait. The Fairhope Council is going to screw the citizens right in the aspirin bottle!!!!!  Won't be the first and won't be the last. So ashamed of the crap that people put up with from the Fairhope Council. Including letting all the citizens fecal crap go everywhere too.  Doesn't everyone realize that this will pollute Fly Creek itself. Don't worry, it test positive for fecal matter also if these apartments go up.
