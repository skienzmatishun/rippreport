 Ripp does post positive things but the Good ole Boys keep being crooked and doing crooked things.  Find me one thing that the current city council has done to improve Fairhope and not sell it to the builders and the political machine?
Hmmmm?
Watch this council get voted out and you will see Ripp write more cheery stuff.
