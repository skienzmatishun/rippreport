 I agree with you, but don't blame Corte......he is just a greedy land-owner who aspires to be Mafia.  The blame lies squarely with Nix, Kant, Burrell, Boone (add Brown proudly to the top of the list).  He purchased those greedy men and he got what he paid for.  Fairhope should learn from this lesson finally, but I am guessing not!
