 Who are you referring too?  As a named Kantlover I only presume you think you’re speaking of MAYOR Wilson. Well she has a Bachelors Degree (and yes she got that AFTER her high school diploma). She does NOT have any tongue rings or other mouth piercings and never has.  And yes she has a tattoo or two - who cares?  The worn knee pads comment you made I’m not sure other than you’re impressed with her successfully competing and completing in Iron Man events. 
Such a small mind but then again you are a Kantlover so I suppose that’s redundant.
