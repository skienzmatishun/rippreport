 Someone please explain how it was legal for Jack Burrell and Fairhope Police Chief Petties to do what they did last night toward the end of the City Council Meeting. Burrell said it was time for PUBLIC COMMENT and step forward to the podium. Paul Ripp was headed to the podium and Burrell told Mr. Ripp he would not allow him to speak and asked the Police Chief to remove him. On what GROUNDS?? Mr. Ripp had not even opened his mouth yet to speak!!  I am assuming the police Chief has to abide by what Burrell ask him to do?? Who does the police Chief work for?
