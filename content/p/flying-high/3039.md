 This type of comment irritates the CRAP out of me!!! Not sure which category that I fall into...Too Old to give a crap or....They don't care about our environment ...or..Just plain ignorant!!  The true fecal crap is not only in the Bay but also sitting in those chairs in the Council Chambers disguised as City Councilmen. Years ago when Fairhope's population was much less and everyone knew everyone else in town a few residents tried to step forward with what was really going on in Fairhope Goverment and actually tried to run against some of these people but the "Machine" was too powerful and would go out into the community to find one of their own and the "Machine" numbers were growing fast. People not part of the "Machine" either got quashed, were scared of this group, left town or knew that they had to make a living here so they kept quite!  Things are different now with the explosion of people moving in here thinking what a lovely place but then seeing the true backbone of the town. Some of these new residents are speaking up and even the ones that are "Too Old to give a crap" because they don't have to make a living here and do not have some of the fears of the natives. 
Fast Forward....let's ban together and clean the Bay and This Town !!!
I really hate reading these long comments!
Next on the agenda is to clean the County and the State of corruption.
