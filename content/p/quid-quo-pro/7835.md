 Yep, Fairhope’s overmedication can be seen whenever you go to any of the drugstores and see the lines at the pharmacy seeing too many healthy and young looking people standing in line for drugs.
They aren’t getting flu shots or blood pressure meds
They are getting opioids, antidepressants, Ritalin, and Xanax.    These drugs are “prescribed” by young doctors who need to pay off student loans while at the same time afford trophy wives, BMW’s,  and oversized houses.  Therefore, these young doctors will write any script to Fairhopians willing to pay or whoever has the medical insurance that will.  That is why we have so many drugstores here.
So yes, Fairhope is overnedicated.  The result is the Rich bitch, drunken housewife, and whiny kid in rehab effect
