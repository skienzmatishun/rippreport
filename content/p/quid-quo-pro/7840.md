 People please pay attention to what is happening.
If Robert Brown can come in and make millions while we watch him in plain daylight
how much has his boss--the council president--Jack Burrell--made?
This is sad for Fairhope. There is no way we can be a top city and meet our needs
with criminals in office. Robert and Jack are bad guys. The other "men" on the 
council are complicit at best and they have their secret deals too. Sickening.
