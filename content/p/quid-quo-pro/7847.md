 The City owns the gullies which make up out watershed system. FSTC wants to get in the "development" business after over 100 years of preserving land for parks and community enhancement. Screams special interests. Its whole mission is being turned upside down because some of the board members stand to benefit GREATLY from this proposed subdivision. There are no rules or transparency at FSTC.

Cliff Pitman is on the voting board of FSTC and his partner is Councilman Robert Brown. Last time citizens apposed it, Robert (Jester) was trying to tell everyone what a great project it was for the sole purpose of reaping the financial benefits of it being approved. Highly unethical. 

The parcel FSTC is trying to develope will most certainly negatively affect this sensitive watershed. It's against everything FSTC is about. And the only way to make sure they do the right thing is for them to receive serious heat from the community to do the right thing. Restrict its use to a natural state forever.
