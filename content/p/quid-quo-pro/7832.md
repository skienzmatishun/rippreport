 I am unclear about the 'gully' comments.  Who owns the gully and what is being developed there? Sorry that I have forgotten the issue from the last attempt (which I believed was shut down).  If anyone has current details, please share.  I still don't believe that either Cliff Pitman or Robert Brown are less than honorable, but I do with that Brown didn't worship the Burrell Devil.
