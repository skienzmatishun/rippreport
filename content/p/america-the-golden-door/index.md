AMERICA

“Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!” Statue of Liberty Poem

Also known as the Statue of Liberty poem, New Colossus and its famous last lines have become part of American history. Here is the sonnet in its entirety:

New Colossus

Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame, With conquering limbs astride from land to land; Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame. “Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!” cries she With silent lips. “Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”

Where was your great grandfather from? He may have read these words when he arrived in the land of the free!

“Forcible separation of children from their parents is clinical child abuse”.

The Ripp Report has followed the Baldwin County Family Court for Years. Judge Michelle Thomason has separated children from their mothers, when their were other options, in many divorces. These children carry those scars with them, many times their whole lives, This is child abuse, a bonus for divorce. “Forcible separation of children from their parents is clinical child abuse”. Child abuse has no excuses.

“Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!

GOD BLESS AMERICA THE GOLDEN DOOR
