Roy Moore disqualified himself long before the sexual allegations were levied at him, by multiple and creditable sources. Moore violated his oath of office, twice, and was removed from office for violating the same constitutional rights he swore to protect. Yet he uses the same Constitution as his rally cry for votes. This is a fact not fake news, yet some voters are willing to overlook Moore’s defiance for the law, putting party first, at all costs.

How can an individual who has violated the oath of office for The Alabama Supreme Court, twice, be expected to honor the Oath Of Office for the US Senate? Better yet how can he even be a viable candidate?

{{< socialpreview url="https://web.archive.org/web/20180926155628/ttp://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/Feature_Homepage_TheOathWeTake.htm" >}}

The US Senate has already announced plans to kick Moore out of the Senate if he happens to win. That is going to be one more black eye for Alabama. Moore has reaffirmed how corrupt and politically dysfunctional Alabama has become.

{{< socialpreview url="https://web.archive.org/web/20181111230902/https://www.foxnews.com/politics/roy-moores-sexual-assault-allegations-cloud-alabama-special-senate-election" >}}

Moore has been shunned by fellow republicans and asked to step down by the Republican leadership.

{{< socialpreview url="http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/11/roy-moore-urged-to-resign-after-report-of-relationships-with-teens" >}}

Moore is determined to bring down the whole State of Alabama and embarrass his own political party. Alabama will be on the world stage, for all the wrong reasons.

Moore’s next stage is Oak Hollow, Fairhope, Dec 5th. This will be a stage ripe for trouble as Mr. Moore continues his campaign of denial and fake news.

Remember it is your constitutional right to peacefully protest the venue and make clear Roy Moore does not represent Alabama. Morals first, party second.
