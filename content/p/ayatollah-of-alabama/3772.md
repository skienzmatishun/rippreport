 Rock n Roll for Moore. Not sure we can trust either. But can bet in Roy to get the things we have been working hard to get. If all these other senators are not stepping down like the private sector individuals have been forced to. Then why should we pin anything in Roy Moore. If Senator Conyers where to step down today. I would not vote for more. What's so special about his ass or ole frank end stein. If I had done any of these things. The people would not have to worry about voting or not voting for me. My wife and friends would have be tied to carcasss of meat and fed to the alligators. If one is being blamed. Then they should all walk out. If not.  Keep on trucking Moore. I'll be there for you!
