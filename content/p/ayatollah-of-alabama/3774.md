 They won't unseat him without unseating others at the same time. If they chose not to do that. Nobody will go unseated. We need records on politicians and hold them accountable just the same as the private sector. You wanna bet if Roy Moore gets elected that they will just hold court in him alone. Not happening.  It will not be allowed without others being unseated. It would be unconstitutional. For or against. I want Truth!
