 I had a polling organization call me and ask me who I favored in the Congressional election.  I told them anyone but Hightower.  They asked me why and I said he is a Catalyst.  I asked them to please write down my reason so the Hightower campaign will see it and become aware that Catalyst is not a "Guaranteed win."
I hope more and more politicians become aware that using Catalyst is a liability.
