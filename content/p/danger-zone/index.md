Highway 98 and Parker Road are becoming more dangerous with every passing day. You can thank the CATALYST Fairhope City Council, former Fairhope Mayor Canâ€™t, and property owner Angelo Corte, a CATALYST supporter.

The below listed complaint effects every motorist traveling through the intersection. Please read this, it is what happens when you have politicians and developers in the same bed.
