 Paul, I hate to say it but this complaint is not going to do anything.   The elected officials are laughing at this. 
I do hope it will make the voters vote out the current elected officials who allow thus.
Corte and his Catalyst colleagues are investing lots of money to elect and keep pro-development people in office. 
Just thinking of what is happening is making my blood boil.   I am waiting until Election Day and will vote for anybody NOT affiliated with Catalyst.
I hope the majority of the voters do likewise
