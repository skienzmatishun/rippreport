 Hey Tippster,
Catalyst will rig it for sure.  Look at what they did in the last elections.  For instance:
In Daphne, they shut down the minority precincts and moved them to City Hall in favor of Catalyst.
In Fairhope where the election to move to district voting in place of at-large, they had ONE single voting booth with a long line to discourage voters from voting in that election.  See, Catalyst HATES districts in favor of at-large elections.  At-large elections allows for them to buy strategic votes in all places.
Hey Baby Boone and Catalyst Cronies:  Are you getting it that we are figuring out your strategies and are working to stop you?
