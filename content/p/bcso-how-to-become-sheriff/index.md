First I would like to thank all the people who have warned me of retaliation that I may receive for writing the truth about BCSO and Sheriff Mack. Let me assure you that I have talked with the Attorney General’s office, FBI and other federal officials. I not only talked with them but provided documents. In addition we have talked with CNN, Investigative reporters, not in Alabama, Netflix and several producers that may be interested in a documentary.


Intimidation and fear are weapons of the Sheriff and as a result the people of Baldwin County do not trust BCSO. That needs to change!


Attorneys now represent Lawrence and are wading through the court system seeking long awaited justice.


Sheriff Mack was elected and promoted from Captain to Sheriff for assisting in the wrongful conviction of Murray “Bubba” Lawrence Jr. Then the Sheriff hired Antony Lowery, who had no field experience, to carry his water and go along with anything Mack said. Lowery and Dean McGowan were both involved in the capital murder case of Lawrence.


Sheriff Mack, Lowery and McGowan, all investigators, produced not one shred of evidence. In their testimony in court they all rambled about how they conduct investigations, their qualifications ect. and their, failed attempt, to even establish a crime scene or identify a murder weapon.


During the course of the trial Mack contradicts himself about evidence of a trunk liner. In court Mack claims he personally handled the evidence. However in court the same trunk liner could not be conclusively identified.


Another interesting fact is that the last person to see the victim, Brandon Hastings, alive, never testified. How in the hell do you have an investigation of a murder and not call the last person to see the victim alive? Unless their testimony did not favor a conviction.


The autopsy of Mr Hastings was conducted in Mississippi witnessed by Dean McGowen,

John Stewart and Tony Fuqua. The cause of death was listed as asphyxiation by strangulation. They were there for the autopsy, they heard Dr.Paul McGarry’s conclusion.


However the prosecution, David Whetstone and Sheriff Mack ignored the Mississippi autopsy findings and came up with a theory of a gunshot. They never produced a weapon or ballistics. They just believed the BS that the actual killer told them.


Sheriff Mack, District Attorney David Whetstone and Judge Robert Wilters ordered the body exhumed and another autopsy in Baldwin County. They held this exculpatory evidence from the defense. This evidence was found in 2023 and all three acknowledge, in a Lagniappe cover story Digging Deep, that they did not give it to the defense. Not only a clear violation of the law, but evidence that proves Lawrence was innocent. Despicable behavior that has incarcerated an innocent man for 20 years.

Ask yourself: If they did this in 2003/2004 how many more innocent people has Mack convicted?


The only police officer, not the case officer, that testified during the trial that did not follow Mack, Wilters and Whetstone down their rabbit hole was Tony Fuqua.


Page 1591 of the transcript, which is close to the end of the trial, defense attorney Willy Huntley asks Officer Fuqua, who had attended the Brandon Hastings autopsy in Mississippi and heard the conclusion of the Dr. Paul McGarry a forensic pathologist who had preformed 12,000 autopsies.

>**A** -   No sir.

>No Answer.

They also had no blood, no witness, no crime scene. Five people testified as to the whereabouts of Murray Lawrence the night of the murder. Whetstone discredited their testimony saying they were all drug users. Jarius McNeal was a suspect immediately and was the sole person responsible for the death of Brandon Hastings. Jarius was told by Mack that he would receive the death sentence unless he could name an accomplice. To save his own life he implicated his best friend Murray Bubba Lawrence. The entire case was surrounded around what the actual killer said, without any other evidence.


To become Sheriff, Mack sent an innocent man to jail for life, without the possibility of parole. He had the help of the Judge and prosecutor who hid exculpatory evidence from the defense. The sad irony is the actual killer got life with the possibility of parole. He is eligible now for parole while Murray Bubba Lawrence remains in Holman Prison.


Sheriff Mack will not be missed and Anthony Lowery who is alleged to have some of the same habits of Andre Reid should leave through the same door Mack exits.


The articles below are not as telling as the comments submitted. These comments, many by sheriff deputies, paint a picture of a good ole boy culture that has many lawyers and judges as members.

Believe it or not the Ripp Report knows far more, however we will wait till certain people firmly have their foot in their mouth, then we will print it.


Baldwin County Sheriff’s Office needs a deep cleaning, starting from the top. Please be pro active in the selection of the new sheriff.
