# Transcript

On April 6, 2003, 21-year-old Brandon Hastings was murdered in Baldwin County, Alabama, by Jerryus McNeil, an African American man with prior federal convictions. McNeil, who had known Hastings for years despite their socioeconomic differences, killed him via ligature strangulation at a wooded area on County Road 49. The cause of death, confirmed by Dr. Paul McGarry’s autopsy, was asphyxia from fractured hyoid bones, hemorrhages, and collapsed lungs—no gunshot wounds or bullet evidence existed. No blood was found on the Acura’s trunk liner, and no fingerprints, DNA, or ballistics linked Murray Bubba Lawrence Jr. to the crime.  

McNeil, already indicted for the murder, pleaded guilty to felony murder to avoid the death penalty. He claimed to have met Hastings at a payphone in Foley, arranged a meet at 1:30 a.m., and drove him to the murder site. He later disposed of the body in Mississippi, arriving at 4:54 a.m., and removed the car’s speakers, which were placed in the home of Tanya Mixon and Stacey Giambrone. The speakers, central to the prosecution’s narrative, were never recovered or admitted as evidence.  

Key contradictions undermine the case: the trunk liner had no blood despite the body being placed face down; the prosecution claimed a gun was used but provided no shell casings or bullet fragments; the only person with a motive to lie was McNeil, who had a clear incentive to fabricate a story involving Murray. McNeil’s alibi and movements were inconsistent—e.g., he claimed to have driven to Fairhope at 3:30 a.m., yet was seen at his home at 6:26 a.m., just minutes after sunrise.  

The prosecution, led by District Attorney John David Whetstone, falsely claimed the murder involved a 9mm handgun, despite no evidence, and promoted a fabricated "magic bullet" theory with no shell or blood. Whetstone emphasized drugs and a desire for dominance as motive, ignoring the lack of any drug connection or evidence. Murray, Sr. had no known gun history and no ties to Brandon—neither met, nor shared phones or cars. Murray, Jr. had no prior record, no drug use beyond casual marijuana and coke, and no weapons.  

Critical evidence was suppressed: the autopsy report, which confirmed strangulation, was never admitted in court. The absence of a death certificate or coroner’s report in Alabama violated protocol. Deborah Fudge, the only witness who saw McNeil in the front passenger seat of the Acura at 1:30 a.m., was never called to testify. Her identification of McNeil in a lineup was dismissed.  

A 21-month trial delay stemmed from disputes over the autopsy and lack of forensic support. Whetstone’s case relied on uncorroborated testimony, including a fabricated story of a stranded motorist. Officer Wendell Thomas’s 5:01 a.m. stop of John Wayne Mixon and Crystal Curtis, which aligned with McNeil’s timeline, was not presented. The defense argued that the prosecution’s case failed to meet legal standards for circumstantial evidence, especially given the absence of tangible links.  

The trial’s credibility was further eroded by a jury of eleven white jurors, with the only African American juror dismissed on a technicality. Whetstone’s assertion of a gun being used contradicted the autopsy and failed to meet evidentiary standards. The case was pre-determined by Judge Robert Wilters, requiring only four guilty votes.  

New documents and evidence continue to surface, revealing procedural flaws and potential misconduct. The case is now being investigated as a systemic failure. A documentary, *The Murray Lawrence Jr. Project*, details the evidence and calls for accountability. Public advocacy is urged through dealwiththedevil.com, with calls to write to Murray, contact the Alabama AG and Governor, or contribute to his Spot Fund.
