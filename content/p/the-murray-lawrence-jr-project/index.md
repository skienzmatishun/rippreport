Today we have an audio story for you that has been a long, long time coming. Murray "Bubba" Lawrence Jr was convicted of the murder of Brandon Hastings who disappeared from Foley, Alabama during Spring Break of 2003 and whose body was found a week later near Guitier/Vancleave, Mississippi. The State convicted Lawrence on the word of a co-conspirator, a "Deal With The Devil" according to David Whetstone Baldwin County District Attorney circa 2003. The irony is that then Lt. Huey Mack was the Lead Detective and is now the 5th term Sheriff of Baldwin County and the Judge in the case Robert Wilters is now serving his second term as District Attorney after a 22 year stretch on the bench. You can read along by following the link: https://justiceformurraylawrencejr.com/ and support the efforts to free him by contributing at http://spot.fund/1t4mwsc. Harry Still is no longer Attorney of Record for Murray Lawrence Jr, his petition for a new trial is being handled by The Maxwell- Tillman Law Firm in Birmingham, Alabama based on this newly discovered Brady Evidence.
