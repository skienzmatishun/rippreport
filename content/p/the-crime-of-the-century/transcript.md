# Transcript

A reading from Proverbs extols wisdom and faithfulness, declaring it more valuable than gold and a tree of life that brings long life, riches, and peace. It urges, "My son, do not despise the Lord's discipline," warning that resentment reveals love and care, and calls for sound judgment to ensure safety and peace. Wisdom is essential, with the Lord establishing earth and heavens through it. The divine detests the perverse, cursing the house of the wicked while blessing the home of the righteous, mocking the proud and granting grace to the humble. Honor flows to the wise, shame to the foolish. In a heartfelt close, the speaker thanks the Holy Father for guidance, mercy, forgiveness, and the blood shed for all, ending with a solemn Amen.
