Backstory Podcast breaks down hot topics like Trump’s plans for military rules and free speech, Biden’s pardons for his family and allies, and Alabama’s messy politics. Governor Kay Ivey is under fire for firing Admiral Kent Davis and trying to control the veterans’ board, upsetting veterans who usually support Republicans. A court case says people can’t sue over a wrong SWAT raid, raising questions about police accountability. Alabama lawmakers will debate new laws soon, and Ivey’s speech might hint at her future amid health rumors.

The podcast uncovers a true crime story in Clarke County, where a hospice business had shady ties to a judge, exposing Alabama’s “good old boy” system. Plus, veterans’ programs are in chaos after Davis was ousted, with leaders turning the job into a political role. Learn how power and money hurt regular people in these stories.
