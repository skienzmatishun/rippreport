Please remember all the military personal that gave their life or were wounded defending your rights. All military personal start their military service by swearing an Oath of Enlistment:

I, \_\_\_\_\_, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; and that I will obey the orders of the President of the United States and the orders of the officers appointed ...

In addition to the Oath of Enlistment solders are also reminded of the words on the Statue of Liberty:

On the Statue of Liberty: a gift from the people of France, there are words we know so well:

"Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to be free."

Thatâ€™s the spirit that makes us American.

WE THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES:

PREAMBLE TO THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES

We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.

This is what JULY 4th is all about. These are the standards, that have made America, AMERICA. Do you adhere to the same standards?

## THANK YOU VETERANS
