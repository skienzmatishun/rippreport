# Transcript

The Port Authority’s wetland project, proposed as a 1,200-acre beneficial use area one mile south of the causeway, involves dumping dredge material in 40-acre cells protected by riprap dikes. Plans reveal a berm and tidal pools with ditches covering coal spoil, dumping dredge water two to six feet deep—directly over submerged aquatic grasses. Critics, including Cade Krisner, Baykeepers, and Mobile National Estuary, warn the site’s sensitive ecology makes it dangerously poor, and the promotional website costs more than engineering plans, raising transparency concerns. The project, funded by $2.5M in Restore Act money, lacks public oversight, with no officials attending hearings. Scientists note the area hosts more aquatic species than any U.S. region but is among the most threatened.  

The Kingston coal ash spill (2005) released 5.5M cubic yards of sludge, poisoning 300 acres and leaving a "moon-like" landscape. Despite the scale, no public officials oversee the issue, and Alabama Power continues burying coal ash in ecologically sensitive zones, including the Mobile-Tensaw Delta. At Plant Berry (25 miles north), a 597-acre ash pit—20 times larger than BP’s oil spill—stores arsenic, cadmium, and mercury, with no cleanup or regulation.  

An ancient 10,000-year-old Tupelo Cypress swamp, exposed after Hurricane Opal, lies just south of Orange Beach. The Corps warns against removal under the Antiquities Act, though a judge already owns a piece. Critics highlight political and bureaucratic inaction, including a shift in district lines without political change.  

Alabama’s push to expand gaming in “black belt” areas is dismissed as absurd; a $10,000 bounty law for abortion providers mirrors Texas’s fetal heartbeat law. Redacted transcripts of prisoner Hubbard’s calls reveal limited public access.  

A $4.3M renovation of the former Bryce Superintendent’s house into a special event space, approved by the UA board, includes a large patio. The university’s general counsel responded to a FOIA request with a $311 cost for 2020 football security—contradicting lavish perks. The chancellor and staff confirm the space as a dedicated event venue. A five-year contract was approved for Joe Bonner, mirroring former employee Waldrop, who resigned. Bonner, a veteran advocate, received a lifetime achievement award during a three-hour governor-led presentation.  

After a November 22 boat crash, Fair Hope PD delayed response for six to eight hours—refusing to test the driver, who was a 16-year-old, and took teens home. The boat, allegedly driven by a judge’s son, was allegedly moved offshore for a quiet cruise before striking a pier. No alcohol tests were conducted. The Baldwin County sheriff has strong disdain for Alia Marine Patrol. The incident, occurring at 80°F, involved loud music and neighbors’ complaints. No report was filed within 10 days.  

A man jailed for harassment after a shovel attack was released without bond—despite no prior issues—leading to a renewed warrant and dismissed case. He filed a HUD housing discrimination complaint after his daughter’s Black Lives Matter activity.  

A man received a text joking about "plumbing quitting," which was misinterpreted, printed, and used to justify a custodial arrest—rare in Alabama. He claims his new lease and subsequent harassment are contradictory. He reported a ring doorbell to Fairhope Police, only to find footage wiped. He warns against giving camera control to law enforcement.  

Fairhope lacks leadership: a man jailed for showing up at a police station was freed after hiring an attorney and now sues the city and police. City plans for contractors face pushback over traffic and infrastructure. A proposed hotel on Bayview raises parking and sprawl concerns. Growth outpaces planning, leading to chaotic development and declining quality of life.  

Gill nets, banned for redfish protection, remain in use despite restrictions. One fisherman caught 300 mullet during a storm. BP allocated $43M for oil spill recovery, with funds redirected to prisons. Billionaire Michael Steinhardt agreed to turn over $70M in stolen antiquities.  

In 2021, remains of Auburn student Kyle, who disappeared 45 years ago, were found in a Ford Pinto still intact in rivers—echoing the car’s infamous safety record. A scuba diver found two missing men in a submerged Pontiac Grand Am in Tennessee, solving a 21-year-old mystery.  

The episode concludes with a warm farewell, urging safe holidays and neighborly respect.
