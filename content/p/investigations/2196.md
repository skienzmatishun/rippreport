 I have been reading  Ripp Report and not adding  anything to the conversation for months but have to step in and say all you christians have some sympathy here!   Jester Triple 6 is a pitiful individual that is just looking for and needing a little understanding here. He may not have anyone to listen to him and he has found an audience here and just wants  wants to feel a part of his local society.   Can we not come together and help everyone feel  that they belong and have a say in matters??  Jester is just trying to become a part of what is going on in our town and just because if might not match your feelings does not mean his or her opinion is not important !  Lighten up people!  Jester it is ok for you to voice your opinion!  Christians should be more tolerant !
