 Very sad.  I don't believe much of this post, but it is sad that some lonely person has tried so hard to become important in a community that does not see him.  

That said, please don't 'stir the pot' in a soup of controversy.  The Ripp Report has been correct on so many issues in the past, but it is definitely ignoring the mistakes of Mayor Wilson.  
If Mayor Wilson would admit/correct her errors and the Ripp Report would deign to report them, the City might move forward.  

The Ripp Report is losing its credibility by giving her a 'free pass' for Botox and Lynn, but
Kudos for recognizing the talent of our new Planning Director and acknowledging it.
Fingers crossed for Fairhope!
