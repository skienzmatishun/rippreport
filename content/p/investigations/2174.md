Gestures Of A Jester


He dances                    
             
He juggles

                 He jokes

But inside
           
                He's a very sad bloke                  

Dancing around
In his jingling hat
Until he falls down
How do you like that?

Juggling his hope
As he drops his shame
Watch as he struggles
Are you not entertained!?

He is the punchline
Of his every joke
Laugh with him
He is your very sad bloke

He dances              

He juggles

         He jokes

He is your very sad bloke
