 I'm on my way to Church. Please, let's all just ignore this weak and pitiful Jester poster and get on board with making our city great. If some of Jester's fans want to post something then let them do it. They will show support and some criticism towards Jester just to get you distracted and frustrated. Ignore it. The true citizens are very smart and realize that this will all come to a head very soon. Let Jester post until the cows come home. Big deal. If he's getting to you. He's the winner. Stop now. Make a commitment to ignore Jester and that goes for you to Ripp. Let the evil post by Jester roll off of our backs. We are mature and intelligent people. Now. Have a great Sunday and let's get back to positive thinking and matters at hand. I have total confidence that this can be achieved beginning right now! Thank you. I believe in you all.
