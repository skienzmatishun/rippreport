 The difference is (and I hate that it has to be explained to you) this is Francis Ripp's site, not yours.  So he can say whatever the hell he wants to, and does, with proof.  Because he's no fool and is not going to put himself in legal jeopardy.  Now you, Jester, are simply a contributor to Ripp's page.  This is not your site, so hijacking it with your bullsh*t is annoying to all of us but those in your corner, i.e. other Council members and their families and friends.  What would be cool is if you start your own blog where you can post all your theories and fairy tales that nobody has to read except those who follow you.  This seems win/win to me.  You'd get nothing but positive stroking, which you seem to need, and the rest of us would not have to listen to your inane ramblings.
