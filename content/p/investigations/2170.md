 This is disturbing to me because this is all speculation.  Boone, Brown and Burrell are on the Council together but they are also long-time friends (don't ask me why Brown would want to be friends with them).  I see nothing sinister in the three of them going out for a drink after the Council Meeting.  If they were having a few drinks and laughing about Robert Brown being accused of being Jester 666, how was illegal?

In my opinion, Burrell and Boone are a cancer within Fairhope; however, until we get rid of Mayor Wilson, they are a necessity.
