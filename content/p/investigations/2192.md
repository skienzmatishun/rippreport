 Not to worry I said. It's just not the media that will get Tripp Pittman's Facebook post regarding Autism which he has omitted he could care less about the autism bill and all of those afffected by it, including the ones who have it and their families. But individuals, organizations, civic clubs and members of all the chambers of commerce will get Tripp Pittman's Facebook post and his comments. We don't count on the media. We count on the people who will care about reading some of the material about the worst politician ever!!!
