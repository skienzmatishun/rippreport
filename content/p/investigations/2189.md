 Speak for yourself.  I don't enjoy Jester, not one little bit.  Maybe the first couple of months he was somewhat entertaining but now he's got nothin' new, just blah blah blah.  You know the old expression about "jumping the shark"?  Yeah, Jester jumped it awhile back but loves to hear himself so much he just can't leave.
