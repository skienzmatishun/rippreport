 I love how Frances now can read people's minds, once again crying with no facts. Please read on page 4, line 2 through the end of page 4 and then on page 5 through line 2. Frances, why do you spin the facts into half-truths? Do you really believe that everyone that reads this blog is that stupid, well, maybe most not all of them are! You are certainly on the defense as late, maybe I will state charging you for my remarks! 

Strike Fast! Strike Hard!

Bye, Bye Mr. Tipp the lie,
He drove his Chevy to the level 
then fell inside,
