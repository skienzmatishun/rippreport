 "Yes, I know how to research the deep web, and got caught down there once and my identity was stolen, had to get a new everything and SSN, that was a nightmare. That is why I stated do not venture down there unless you know what you are doing and never trust anyone in the deep web." I'm sorry, that is hilarious. The deep web is designed to hide identities and you manage to lose it? Admit it, you did something stupid to lose that info like type it in somewhere. I think you have a lot of research to do before you make up your next identity.
