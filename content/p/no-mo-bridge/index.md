Talk about shooting yourself in the foot!

Alabama’s Ole Mo probably sunk the Bayway “Truck Bridge” because of his strong conviction of the 10th amendment. Problem is, Alabama has no money and depends on Washington. So the 10th amendment will keep Alabama firmly last place in most major categories?

MO for U.S. Senate means NO More for Alabama.

I-10 IS A FEDERAL HIGHWAY

Brooks said that he would help project supporters, but funding decisions should not be made in Washington.

“I believe in the 10th amendment,” Brooks said. “That means I believe that we ought to shift as much government away from Washington to states and to cities and counties as possible because I believe your best, most responsive government is cities and counties where citizens can get a hold of their people, then state and the worst place is the federal government. So what we have done in Washington is we have sent all of our highway dollars to the states to distribute as they deem best with the exception that we have a certain percentage that has to go to interstates, a certain percentage has to go to U.S. highways, a certain percentage has to be allocated for state roads and so forth.”

Mark Colson, president and CEO with the Alabama Trucking Association “reiterated that the trucking industry believes the plan is unconstitutional because it singles out truckers to finance an interstate project. A federal lawsuit in Rhode Island argues that truck-only tolls discriminate against out-of-state companies, violating the Commerce Clause of the Constitution.”

Jack has said “he is opposed to federal assistance, however, if it was offered he would take the money.”

“Obviously, there’s going to be a toll. We don’t know what that toll is going to look like right now. I think it’s going to be a small toll. But I do think as a passenger vehicle, if you choose to use the bridge, you will pay a toll. But we will maintain those legacy routes.”

It is obvious that the politicians and supporters of the bridge have actually fallen off the bridge. They are stepping all over themselves trying to be conservative to a fault. They cannot build a bridge without federal money, which many feel should be all federal money.

The state of Alabama cannot fund the bridge. It cannot even provide for education, prisons or healthcare. The revenue streams of other states have been ignored by Alabama.

The lottery and legalization of marijuana is providing neighboring states billions while Alabama is going to “study” whether it is feasible. Alabama left $3.2 billion on the table, not participating in Medicaid, further deteriorating an already fractured state wide medical system.

Those yelling the loudest about the bridge are more interested in development than traffic. The politicians listed on this page ensure failure.
