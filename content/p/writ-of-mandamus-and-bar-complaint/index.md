The Ripp Report has filed an ethics complaint against the Ethics Commissioner.

The Ripp Report has also filed a Writ of Mandamus against the Ethics Commission, in conjunction with the Ethics Complaint.

“A (writ of) mandamus is an order from a court to an inferior government official ordering the government official to properly fulfill their official duties or correct an abuse of discretion.”

Mr. Albritton, one of three trustees of the Mabel Amos Memorial Fund, is also an attorney. He is well aware of self dealing and the Internal Revenue Codes related to self dealing and taxable expenditures.

Albrittion’s children have received scholarships, valued at 105,000 dollars, from the fund.

The Ripp Report has filed a separate, Alabama Bar Complaint against Mr Tom Albritton.

These complaints comply with all the guidelines for filing complaints. We will keep you posted on how the complaints fair.

Tomorrow a letter to the Alabama Attorney General, I just want him to be aware of what’s going on.
