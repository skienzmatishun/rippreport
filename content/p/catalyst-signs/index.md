Just like tea leaves if you look close enough at the local political signs they are sending you a subliminal message. If however you do not allow your eyes to rule your brain, the subliminal message is much clearer.

Catalyst has been around for a long time, under various names. Recently Catalyst became Scott Boone Consulting. The name CATALYST had to be abandoned, it had become politically toxic. The other reason is elected officials, elected under the CATALYST banner, were disassociating with the brand.

{{< socialpreview url="https://rippreport.com/p/catalyst-aka-scott-boone-consulting/" >}}

Make no mistake CATALYST/ Scott B??ne, CSB, are one in the same. CSB operates much like the Club for Growth pac, they help you get elected but they own you from that day. They support each other and share among themselves any gratuity they feel entitled to. They form a political alliance that spans the county.

Study the signs and their locations. Notice how CSB candidates signs all are the same, pvc framed. CSG uses signs as their number one tool in elections. Do not make the mistake of thinking this is in only one municipality. CSB put signs up in Fairhope, Daphne, Spanish Fort and Bay Minette, the new home of CSB, overnight, hundreds of signs, all supporting CSB candidates.

The intention is to sell your eyes on their popularity, the trick is to use your brain when you vote

Check out this combination of signs in Fairhope, Sherry, Boone { father of Scott B??ne } Brown and Burrell. This cocktail of candidates is 100% CSB. Voting for these four is going backwards and handing Fairhope over to developers and corrupt politicians.

Watch the signs, Sherry is usually hugged up to Boone signs and in most locations they are all represented. These signs appear in the yards of the core group of the past administration. They want back their power that they lost in 2016. Do not get confused by seeing a sign, this election is a hell of a lot more important than signs. But the signs speak.

SHERRY SNEDEKER BBB

This picture speaks a thousand words. Sherry snuggled up to the Municipal Judges property sign, with Boone Brown and Burrel accompanying signs.

{{< socialpreview url="https://rippreport.com/p/scary/" >}}

The municipal judge is a devout supporter of CSB and the city council has voted in favor of the judge multiple times. Burrell also arranged himself to be on a bid committee that awarded the good judge a prime location for his jet airplane hanger.

Last month the judge had club for growth candidate, “lowtower” signs, on his property, provided by CSB. Thank God Jerry Carl defeated CATALYST/SCOTT BOONE and sent “lowtower” into the shadows.

Daphne is another example of saturated signs by CSB. Check this one out CATALYST/Scott Boone candidates shoulder to shoulder. What should that tell ya, they are a unit not individuals.

CATALYST/Scott Boone and the current Mayor of Daphne are picking your next Mayor and City Council members for you. DO NOT VOTE FOR ANY CSB CANDIDATES.

Signs in Spanish Fort and Bay Minette are all the same style pvc framed CATALYST/Scott Boone signs, manufactured at the same place.

In the next two weeks you will hear of signs missing destroyed or damaged, none of them will be CATALYST/Scott Boone signs. In Fairhope it is already going on, they have perfected the art of sign disappearance in Fairhope. In the 2016 Fairhope election a man was caught with a pickup full of signs, all were signs of those opposing the status quo.

Use your eyes to see, use your brain to think.

## VOTE AUG 25th
