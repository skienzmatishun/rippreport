 Yep, and the developers keep building houses that stress the schools.  The County Commission and local city councils let the developers build more and more.
Why you may ask?  It is because the developers contribute to their hand- picked candidates who will approve the subdivisions.  The developers throw so much money at these vetted politicians that they win office.
I am disappointed in Billie Jo Underwood.  She ran to get a control on growth but now she is running in the same circles with the Catalyst/SCB bunch.  She beat Tucker Dorsey and then Catalyst/SCB bought Billie Jo.
