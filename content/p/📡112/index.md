The lack of Leadership in Alabama is unimaginable. This is the most ineffective and quite frankly unintelligent bunch of legislators to ever occupy our Statehouse. And the Kung-Flu response should have convinced you that our Federal, State and Local Leadership is totally unprepared for much of anything (reminiscent of a Marx Brothers bit).

Another indication of abhorrent leadership is the uncontrolled growth that has led to moratoriums on development in Daphne and Fairhope...predicated on the Constitutional Amendment to regulate private utilities in Baldwin County (going on 10 years and not a peep).

The hoax we can't afford a bridge over the Bay is indicative of what they think of our collective mental acuity. The Tar and Feather Awards are taking nominations and "The Tax-Man" State Senator Chris Elliott is one of four listed on their website at this early date, and we agree, if it were not for fear of law enforcement we would have preformed this Civic Duty years ago.

Meanwhile SARS-COV-2 infections top 50 Million and 800,000 deaths with the majority of the fatalities being 65 and older. Blackhawk Down pilot Mike Durant has entered the Mo Brooks/Katie Britt Senate Race and has taken a 16 % chunk of the field.

And it is the 10th anniversary of the birth of our Spirit Animal here at Backstory Podcast, Mr. Christopher Hitchens.
