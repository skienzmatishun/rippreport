# Transcript

John Morgan, a major Democratic donor, criticizes Kamala Harris’ 2024 campaign, arguing she has lost ground to Barron Trump. Morgan contends Barron’s strategic use of platforms like Joe Rogan’s—particularly targeting younger male voters—outpaced Harris, who relied on outdated, Obama-era media strategies. He asserts Harris’ campaign lacks originality and voter connection, warning that without campaign success, she cannot govern effectively. Morgan urges Harris to seriously consider a future presidential run, framing campaign experience as essential to national leadership. The growing influence of young political figures, especially Barron Trump, raises questions about his role as an unacknowledged asset in the 24 election, signaling a shift in American political dynamics.
