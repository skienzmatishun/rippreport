Notebook LM Podcasts, the Tesla booster catch, the Tesla self driving autonomous "Johnny Cab", and Tesla Semi-Trucks are just some of the tech that came out this week. And while the private sector is winning, The US Government aka FEMA still "cant get water to the Superdome". There is an election in a less than a fortnight and both sides will say just about anything at this point. Governor Ivey came out of cryo-sleep to call for the immediate resignation of the Veteran's Affairs Commissioner for Alabama, the only state public servant that we all agree is slumming working in State Government. At the local level Fairhope is expanding their $9.5M pier remodel, Baldwin County approves thousands of residential lots this week over public outcry but helped us all out by cutting sales tax on hearing aids, way to go! And we have included information so that you can read the Baldwin County sample ballot prior to voting and a link that will tell you where to vote. The City of Bay Minette, Alabama is being sued by the family of OJ French Jr who was killed by BMPD Officer Brandon Thompson. Mobile Attorney Andy Ruten is representing the City and has asked the Judge to review the bodycam to excuse the actions of the officer while insisting that it not be released to The Public. And then Ruten's firm hires Bay Minette Mayor Bob Wills to represent them in a lawsuit where his firm is being sued for Malpractice... The Circle of Life. Southern Research (Institute) is offering FREE genetic testing they say will be used to cure disease and create "targeted treatments"; before you bite you might want to read the fine print (And why give them audience on Alabama Public Television). The Sheriff is still chasing the Duke Boys around the Courthouse and there is still a hot war in Europe and the Middle East. Plus "The Apprentice's" Roy Cohn and Tampon Tim vs the shotgun (bonus content).
