My right total reverse shoulder revision went well last Friday. The Birmingham V.A. is the number one V.A. hospital in the United States, I have had 14 operations their. No matter my health conditions I am always humbled by veterans with far worse injuries than myself. I have one more total reverse shoulder on the left side in December, I hope that is it. The Ripp Report hopes to be back on schedule by Freaky Friday.
