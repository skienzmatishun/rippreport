It looks as if Ripp will keep it up at exposing the Catalysts.  Whenever they make a move, Ripp calls them on it. 
This is all we have as true investigative reporting is concerned in the Mobile area.  Other than the Lagniappe, we have no TRUE journalism.
What is left of the Mobile Press Press Register is not much.  The Mobile Press Register comes out of its grave two or three times a week and covers insignificant stories that it thinks should be worthy of reading when in fact they are just printing anything to provide a reason to carry Shoe Station coupons.  
The Lagniappe was originally a music venue paper but was forced to take up the slack because the Register abandoned its post.  In my opinion the Lagniappe is doing the best it can do given what was thrust upon it but the Lagniappe has to cover the entire Mobile area and must still have the "hip and cool" factor.
This leaves Ripp and he does what the media would not DARE do because the media is too lazy and too busy covering fluff.
