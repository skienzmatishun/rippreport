Can you hear me now! How many times in the last 18 months has the Mayor of Fairhope gone on record, with the City Council, about the lack of communication between the Mayor’s office and the City Attorney.

The Jan. 28th meeting of the Fairhope City Council is a prime example of the lack of communication the Mayor is talking about. The City Attorney and the Council President, Captain Jack, took it upon themselves to make decisions about the Golf Course equipment, without advising the Mayor of any details or problems.

{{< socialpreview url="https://rippreport.com/p/captain-jack/" >}}

State law defines the distinct roles of mayor and council. The city cannot run effectively with a city attorney who refuses to work with the mayor.

The Council President and the City Attorney cannot direct employees nor interfere with the daily business. That is exactly what they did, again.

Do ya want to know why people do not go to the Council meetings? Just watch this 39 minute circus. Keep in mind this discussion about the equipment began in Oct. 2018.

https://youtu.be/Pr0YLTTHDaM?t=2340

COMMUNICATION or shall we say lack there of, should be the topic of conversation. Captain Jack and the City Attorney Marcus McDowell start rambling about everything but the issue, a total lack of communication.

During the meeting the Mayor asked the City Attorney “why did he not reach out to her?” McDowell shot back that why did, “she not reach out to him”. What the hell, McDowell works for the City and is is suppose to advise the Council and Mayor, in the best interest of the City. He is also not suppose to be, nor get away with being, insubordinate to the Mayor. He has no worries though because Capt Jack has his back.

Now let’s cut to the chase, Ripp Report style, McDowell is a holdover from the Mayor Can’t era. Captain Jack and the Council selected McDowell to carry their water and help pave the way to a Catalyst overthrowing the present Fairhope Government, in 2020. Capt Jack or Sherry Sullivan may be the Catalyst choice for Mayor but McDowell will be secure in his job as the Catalyst City Attorney.

McDowell and Capt Jack also get credit for the Federal lawsuit, that cost taxpayers, but not Capt. Jack, thousands of dollars. McDowell and the Captain could not settle a school yard brawl. They compounded the case until the City’s insurance Company took over to settle it. McDowell made an ass of himself and Jack was holding his hand.

The City Attorney nor Capt. Jack ever explained the police report Mr Burrell had been hiding for years. Again the Council and City Attorney just ignored the issue. He is the CITY attorney and should have released a statement about the Captain’s police report, when it came to light.

{{< socialpreview url="https://rippreport.com/p/see-ya-in-court-jack/" >}}

The City Council did not want to listen to the Mayor about her concerns as to the Council selecting McDowell as City Attorney. However they said nothing when they lost the lawsuit. There was no accountability, Capt Jack and McDowell suddenly did not want to talk about it.

{{< socialpreview url="https//rippreport.com/p/loser/" >}}

Then we have the very suspicious connection between the City Attorney Jack Burrell and Ronan McSharry.

Her we go again:

Let’s see what surprises Mr. McDowell comes up with as a “Public Prosecutor”, in the ongoing antics and assaults by Mr. McSharry.

{{< socialpreview url="https://rippreport.com/p/barstool/" >}}

This was suppose to go to court today I predict they will postpone the case until a later date. This is the same thing they did when McSharry threatened Nall, the artist. It will be postpone, postpone, postpone, then blame the victim or anyone else other than the guilty party.

McSharry is a frequent flyer with the courts and Mr. McDowell has been to court at least three times as public prosecutor representing citizens that have fallen victim to Mr. McSharry assaults or harassment.

McSharry who owns McSharrys bar and restaurant, features a J. Burrell sandwich on the menu, his connection to McSharry is obvious. McSharry keeps going to court and each time it seems they only slap his hand. McDowell has not represented the citizens of the community when it comes to McSharry. You have heard the saying “if you see something say something”. Well this is the 5th or 6th run in with the law by Mr. McSharry, 3 in the last 18 months. All involved alcohol, harassment or assault. I guess if no one cares about Jack’s police record why should they be concerned about McSharry’s criminal past? It is just a bunch women who have been abused!

The City Council hired Mr McDowell and they need to fire him, asap. The council will be held responsible for Mr. McDowell’s actions, and trust me there is much more to come.
