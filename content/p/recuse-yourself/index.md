COFAIRHOPE: ATTENTION MAYOR AND COUNCIL

Dear Mayor and Council please take your positions seriously and understand that a part of your responsibilities is to discipline yourselves. The Fairhope City Council in the past has ignored any conflicts of interest, they may have, while voting on issues that they are personally involved with or have a business interest related to the applicant.

The last council meeting had several members of the council that had conflicts of interest when it came to the voting on the extension of the sunset clause related to Fly Creek Apartments.

Mr. Boone is by far the most conflicted councilmen with a trail of llc’s that would require a full time investigation to sort out. He is also directly related to Catalyst which is a conflict in itself. In January we asked the council to look into what extent Mr. Boone was involved with Mr Angelo Corte.

The council was also copied documents that supported the obvious conflicts of interest Mr. Boone had.

How much more do you need, because there is more, to convince you that Mr. Boone should not be voting on any Fly Creek Apartment votes or Preble-Rish related issues.

The Alabama Ethics Commission has been perfectly clear on the responsibilities of city councils and it’s members when it comes to conflicts of interest. It is your responsibility to prevent conflicts of interest, not turn a blind eye to the obvious.

Mr. Boone deserves a full investigation into his business interest and his multiple llc’s, something the council does not have the stomach for, however they can force Mr. Boone to recuse himself from this point forward on voting, on any issue related to Angelo Corte or the Fly Creek Apartments.

It should be noted that some of the conflicts of interest Mr. Boone has, date back prior to him being elected. He never exposed the fact that he had business interests with Preble-Rish or with Angelo Corte.

Just how many votes has Mr. Boone cast for his self interest?
