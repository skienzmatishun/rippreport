As predicted, Ronin McSharry, owner and operator of McSharry's Irish Pub in Fairhope, Alabama is again charged with Domestic Violence and surrendered to authorities on Friday. Your US Legislature killed a Law that would have required the VA to provide coverage to veterans with cancer who were exposed to toxic burn pits while in The Service. Chris Elliott and Jack Burrell are pimping the $3Billion Mobile Bayway Project, who you gonna trust if not that gaggle? New detail emerge regarding the incentives given to Novell to locate their $2Billion aluminum facility to the Baldwin County Mega Site. One component is that they must create a training facility in the Daphne Technology Park (a disappointment of a project thus far) a long dive from the Mega Site (Cui Bobo). And finally, months after the primary, AL.COM Lagniappe, ECT are finally writing about the train wreck that is our current Attorney General Steve Marshall. And some predictable retaliations from the Alabama State Bar related to a lawsuit against them. Monkey Pox will be on an elevator button near you, soon. And third plague: Trump will soon announce his third run. Strange blood clots have been reported by an Alabama undertaker stating that this is something he has observed in the deceased since the vaccine was administered to the masses. The Baldwin County High School Class of 1992 will be having their reunion tonight at the Holly Hills Country Club in Bay Minette, minus one for sure; thirty years and Generation X have yet to make a dent. Stay tuned.
