As predicted, Ronin McSharry, owner and operator of McSharry's Irish Pub in Fairhope, Alabama is again charged with Domestic Violence and surrendered to authorities on Friday. Your US Legislature killed a Law that would have required the VA to provide coverage to veterans with cancer who were exposed to toxic burn pits while in The Service. Chris Elliott and Jack Burrell are pimping the $3Billion Mobile Bayway Project, who you gonna trust if not that gaggle? New detail emerge regarding the incentives given to Novell to locate their $2Billion aluminum facility to the Baldwin County Mega Site.

And some predictable retaliations from the Alabama State Bar related to a lawsuit against them. Monkey Pox will be on an elevator button near you, soon. And third plague: Trump will soon announce his third run.
