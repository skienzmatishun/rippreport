 Dear Fruitnut,
I am sorry to hear of this.  Yor yard is your yard regardless of the outer color of your skin.  Underneath we are all red in color until we get to the whites of our bones.
If somebody can come into your yard and steal from you without consequences, then everyone else is a potential victim.  Who said that an injustice anywhere is an injustice everywhere? 
If trespassers can steal from this Marine, then everybody else is potentially the next victim.
If I see a no trespassing sign, that is all the deterrent I need.  Save your shotgun powder, you won't need to use it on me...
