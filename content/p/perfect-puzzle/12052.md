 What's really insane is that so many of these black residents are from old, long-established families that have lived here for generations only to see this area forcing them out of their own hometown thanks to SCB/Catalyst/Cox.  When will the long time residents - both black and white - stand up to the bully politicians owned by this crooked outfit?
We must vote these people out...  Hey Scott and Nathan, we got your number.  Go and hide behind a new company name.  We know who you are and what ever you will call yourself next election.
