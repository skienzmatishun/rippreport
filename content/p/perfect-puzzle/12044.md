 I doubt if the Court of Public Opinion is ever in session.
The Mobile Register has been reduced to selling ads for Shoe Station, Gulf Coast Newspapers just covers public interest articles, and the TV media just wants to cover shootings, wrecks, and the occasional tornado.
Don't even think about investigative journalism - it just costs too much and it siphons off editors' bonuses on ad sales.  When it comes election time, the voters look at the candidates and the candidate that says "Christian Conservative" the loudest gets the votes.
The voters don't even know who Albriton is, let alone what he does.  Also, so many of the people in Baldwin County have recently moved here, do not know the politics, and are too busy working jobs to pay the mortgages on the houses built by Cox and his group of predatory developers.
