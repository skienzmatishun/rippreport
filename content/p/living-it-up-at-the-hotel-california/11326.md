 "I’ve collected files on corruption in governments. For the first time, I’m naming names and specifics. I’ll begin with a corrupt CIA agent and two Bahamian officials. Coming today. If I’m arrested or disappear, 31  terabytes of incriminating data will be released to the press."

He claimed to have a dead man switch that would release this information. 

A dead man switch decrypts data when the owner does not "check in" with it. He had nothing.  This data would be distributed throughout the etherium cryptocurrency blockchain which would prevent interference from anyone. It was a bluff.
