 Hey Jackoff4fairhope,
If you know more than Ripp tune state what you know. McAfee didn’t have a list of prostitute clients like Epstein.   Since you have some inner truth, why don’t you tell us who is paying off the Fairhope council that allow them to change the place of the new station that was going behind Winn Dixie?   Oh wait you don’t have to.  That property is marked to be sold to some developers due to its location
See? You cannot distract Ripp or throw him off his game
You Catalysts think you are so sneaky and stealth but your greed makes you so obvious
Now go and put your head back up Jack’s butt
