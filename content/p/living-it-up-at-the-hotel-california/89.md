 Yes, I TRULY believe that the developers must pay their fair share in impact fees.  The developers impose high density housing developments that stresses the infrastructure such as the roads, utilities, and services such as police and garbage.  Because developers are not made to pay these fees, WE THE PEOPLE have to pay in the form of upgrades, more traffic and a worsening quality of life.  
The developers are literally STEALING our life style, selling it, and making money at OUR expense!!!   Then, when they ruin things for us, they leave the area looking for another place to pillage and loot. The developers have had a free ride for too long.  It is time they answer for what they do.
