83,718,625 SARS-COV-2 cases worldwide with 1,822,467 deaths. The USA has topped 30 Million cases and suffered 350,000 deaths. AstraZeneca vaccine was approved for use in the UK. The US Senate just voted to override Trump's veto of the National Defense Appropriation Bill, which will limit his powers to withdraw troops in certain circumstances and renames all bases named for the losers in the War of Northern Aggression (that's a joke).

Trump Pardons 50 plus, we break down the worst.

What's hidden in the Coronavirus Relief Bill (from amberjack counting in the Gulf to the creation of a Copyright Claims Board)? Russia hacked half of corporate America and most of the Government, why no coverage?

Justice Lyn Stuart was given the Howell Heflin Award.

As goes Georgia so goes the Senate, runoff January 6, 2021.

Dr. Robert Bentley got the vaccine to the amusement of no one.

The Nashville Christmas Day bombing tragedy (5G) and The Pope's new Instagram Bikini Model pal.
