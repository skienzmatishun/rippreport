# Transcript

The host recounts a game session marked by repeated crashes and technical glitches, including a failed save just after escape, highlighting persistent issues in even remastered editions of older games. After a crash at the end of the previous episode, progress is lost, forcing a restart from three turns back. Strategy pivots: Northern Italy is abandoned, and forces retreat to Constantinople to reclaim the Middle East, with heavy emphasis on defending the capital via high taxes. Troops are reallocated to Palestine and Tripoli; unexpectedly, Georgia flips, likely due to troop movements from abandoned provinces. With a port secured, the Sultan exits Sardinia and targets Naples, potentially joining forces as they exit Genoa. Hungarians may attack, following a prior campaign pattern. Cavalry is moved from Finland, where public order remains stable, and troops are redirected to Constantinople, though Hungarian boats trap the player, making carvels a key threat. Finance is strained: lower taxes and a weak peasant squad are sent to Chernigov via canals, though movement is limited. Public order in Palestine fluctuates, requiring constant management. The strategist admits inability to move troops from contested areas and opts to route forces through Tuscany, reunite in Rome, and exploit Baghalas’ arrival to strike the carvel fleet by sea. Despite Sardinia’s low income, Sicily is prioritized for its trade value. Unexplained islands appear, likely a glitch, while rebel forces spawn in recently lost provinces. Plans shift to evacuate troops from Cyprus and Rhodes to Naples, though these units perish without ports. The King of the Romans is noted in Rome, suggesting a potential coordination hub. Forces are then withdrawn from Tuscany and the Papal States due to low strategic value and high maintenance, with taxes maximized to extract remaining income. The King is recalled to Rome, and forces are deployed to crush a crusade in Arabia. A horse archer is sent to lesser Armenia for support, while tax drops are implemented in the northeast. Cargill’s travel disrupts trade and troop movement, adding pressure. The host acknowledges poor money management as a critical flaw. They plan a two-year campaign to reclaim lost ground and assess crusade reinforcements. Despite improved graphics and sound, remastered versions still contain persistent bugs, underscoring unresolved legacy development challenges. The session ends with frustration over technical failures, but acceptance that such glitches remain common in older game iterations.
