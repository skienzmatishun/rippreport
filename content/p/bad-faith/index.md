From The FBI to The Alabama Legislature and the United States Congress and even the City of Dothan Alabama, this week we detail the Bad Faith exhibited by our governments at all levels. From Whistleblower harassments, the Debt Ceiling debate, Space Command being stripped from Alabama, and the ALDOT Bridge onto Pleasure Island it truly is the "Hive of Scum and Villainy" that Obi Wan warned about. Doubt us, call one of your friends in Gulf Shores and ask them what they think of the drug fueled music festival that locals abhor, Hangout Fest kicked of this afternoon at 3pm.
