 I don’t think anyone cares about the attorneys involved in this case. Money or no money. Wrong is wrong. If you look at the Jack Burrell has addressed Mayor Karin Wilson on many occasions and on video as well. There might not be many men with balls in Fairhope, but they wouldn’t allow Jack Burrell to talk to the Mayor or any other woman in this city. Wake up Fairhope Women. You have a narcissistic evil person who has without a doubt been worse to women than a lot of these women who are speaking up about being treated wrong in any sorts. I know a lot of true, independent and wonderful strong women in this city and when they finally figure out how Jack Burrell and his horsemen are treating the Women of Fairhope.  “You will see the women take a stand”.
