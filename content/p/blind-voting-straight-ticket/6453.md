 Dear Ripp,
I see your point in lamenting on the blind straight ticket voting.  But the only other option is to vote Democrat and the Democrats are just too liberal for the "typical" Baldwin County voter.  When the typical Baldwin County voter sees a Democrat on the ballot, all he or she can think of is Pelosi, Schumer, and Anifa.
The Democrat Party has swung so far to the left that it looks just plain eaten up with the crazies and the conservative voters in Baldwin County just cannot and will not vote for such a candidate associated with the Democrat party.
When a candidate runs for office in Baldwin County, he or she knows that he or she MUST get on the Republican side of the ballot in order to hope to win.  I think it is a shame because the Republican Party has been a major vehicle for the Catalyst bunch to get into office and be crooked.
Back in the 1980's and early 1990's, there was an Orange Beach Republican Party that broke off of the main County Republican Party and ran some successful candidates.
Perhaps this could be a workable solution to get the Catalyst Cancer out of the Baldwin County Republican Party.  Just a though.  Anyone have another idea?
