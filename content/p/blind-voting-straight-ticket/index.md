Want to know why Alabama is the most corrupt state in the United States? Want to know why Alabama health care and education is rated as the worst in the United States?

Blind Voting known as straight ticket voting. Alabama is one of 8 states that has straight ticket voting.

Republican or Democratic, straight ticket voting encourages corruption, by just voting in the same candidate because of his party affiliation.

{{< socialpreview url="https://www.al.com/election/2018/11/elections-2018-how-to-vote-a-straight-party-ticket-in-alabama.html" >}}

Alabama elected a Governor that did not even have to debate. All she had to do was wait for the blind to cast their vote. We will remain dead last as long as we put party before candidate.
