 I don't believe that Gulf Coast News Today could be considered a news organization, even under the most lenient definition.  It reads more like the 'Burrell Blog'; if it goes away for good, I will be happy for Fairhope.  The blogger does his best to sensationalize everything negative about the City.  I hope he is sued into oblivion.
