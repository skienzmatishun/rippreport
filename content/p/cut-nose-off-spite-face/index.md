The quality of life in Fairhope is now being degraded by a city council that is more interested in failure than success. The current and past council president, Jack Burrell, along with his accomplice Kevin Boone, have successfully slowed city government and services to a point that had best concern us all. They have been engaged in a vindictive campaign to undermine the newly elected mayor.

Mayor Wilson fired two employees, which is her prerogative as well as her responsibility if an employee or employees are not representing the city in the manner expected of them. Mr. Burrell and Mr. Boone then led the council to install a hiring freeze to PUNISH the mayor. They have additionally slowed down the budget process to a stalemate without providing any valid reasons.

They are pursuing revenge for the good ole boy network that lost the election. We, the citizens, are going to pay the price unless we can convince the council that they are on the wrong path. The mayor is doing her job while the council has become an obstructionist. That is affecting the morale of our employees, our quality of life, education of our children and community.

The mayor is being transparent when she addresses the community and explains the repercussion of the council recent actions. In the coming weeks you are going to be made aware of some facts that will prove just how low Mr. Burrell and Boone are willing to stoop.

{{< socialpreview url="https://rippreport.com/p/recuse-yourself/" >}}

Fairhope is in reverse:

> “Fairhope has incredible potential to be greater and more successful than ever! But obstructions like the hiring freeze will prevent the city's success. Understand, even when the hiring freeze is lifted, the job openings have to be posted, interviewed, hired and trained. We have lost almost two months of this process. Expect at least this amount of time to get back on track.” Mayor Wilson.

Alabama is currently the most corrupt state in the US, without a doubt, Baldwin County is the most corrupt county and Fairhope WAS the most corrupt municipality. If Mr. Burrell and Mr. Boone succeed, we all fail and Fairhope falls back into the hands of the good ole boys and again we become the most corrupt municipality.

DO NOT MISS THE NEXT COUNCIL MEETING SEPT. 24.

WHY DOES THE PUBLIC HAVE NO VOICE

CITY OF FAIRHOPE CITY COUNCIL AGENDA MONDAY, 24 APRIL 2017 - 6:00 P.M. - CITY COUNCIL CHAMBER Invocation and Pledge of Allegiance 1. Approve minutes of 10 April 2017 Regular City Council Meeting, minutes of 10 April 2017 Work Session, and minutes of 10 April 2017 Agenda Meeting. 2. Report of the Mayor 3. Mayor's Veto of An Ordinance Amending Ordinance No. 1572: Fly Creek PUD Sunset Provision; Paragraph 3 (a). 4. Public Participation - Agenda Items - (3 minutes maximum)

Mr.Burrell has placed the Mayor’s veto before public participation, as Jack has explained, “the council has afforded us the privilege to attend not necessarily to comment.” That is not transparency!
