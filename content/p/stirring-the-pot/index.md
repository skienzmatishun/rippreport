No Wonderful Wednesday today, sorry, The Ripp Report got an invite to Montgomery. I will be there a couple of days stirring the pot. Here is something to keep ya busy.

Who”s telling the truth? “come fly with me” Burrell has no answers.

Listen and think. The Airport has cost us millions while we invest little in our schools.

It’s alright for “come fly with me” Jack to hire an attorney, read the letter, but not alright for the Mayor. Karma and Fate are going to catch Jack and then he will really need an attorney

THINK ABOUT IT ! SEE YA FREAKY FRIDAY
