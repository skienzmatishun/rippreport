 Name the elected officials who stood up for citizens early on please because I want to know who listens to their constituents. And let us know the people who were supportive supportive of the toll. Know Chris Elliott was for the toll and heard him today acting as if he saved the day and blamed everything on Ivy. 
 I'll assume anyone not mentioned, never took a stand one way or the other. Didn't care about us!  Thank you Ripp for your service.
