 I watched good fellas over the weekend. It's the movie with Joe Pesci and DeNero.
Anyways, in the movie the guys that knock off the airport vault for millions start
using their ill-gotten gains to buy fancy clothes, cars, etc. This pissed off
the mob bosses who got most of the loot. Everyone had been instructed not to spend
their cash until the heat blew over.  

I guess Robert Brown (dream home) never saw this movie?
