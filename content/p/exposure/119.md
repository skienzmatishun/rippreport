 These are two quotes taken from email responses and are typical everyday occurrence's  in Judge Thomason Court.
“On our final hearing Judge Thomason granted me curtain things but when I got the final decree in the mail the things she granted me were not in it. When I went back to court to address this issue I was told she wasn't changing it.
 “When it takes a half dozen attempts at enforcing a court order in her court with no success something needs to be done. I lost my life savings, all belongings of value, my income and got 50/50 week on week off shared custody”
