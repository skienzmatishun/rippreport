 I know of two who plan on running. We really do need civic minded people. I did not know Mr. Brown built the soccer field itself. I had always heard he built the concession stands...at least ge bragged openly he did. He built a obnoxious house with all that public monies. This is a bad look for fairhope in 2020, god forbid 1980. Keep after these bad people Ripp.
