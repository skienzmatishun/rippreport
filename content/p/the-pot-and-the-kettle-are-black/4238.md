 Fortunately I can't identify a number of posters. I understand that many do not approve of some of the votes or lack thereof by the Fairhope City Council and some Baldwin County officials. I
think accusations of kickbacks and
self dealing are overstated unless you have proof and not just the appearance of questionable dealing. More importantly several people have stated how unChristian like (for want of another term) said politicians are behaving.  I think you are perhaps crossing a line you should not cross. I note the Mayor, who is no fan of the Council members, may complain about how they act but she has (appropriately) refrained from JUDGING her adversaries in those terms. I hope at least that degree of civility can be maintained. Believe me when I read some of what is being said I prefer to support the opposite of what they are saying. We can disagree and criticize without being so hateful
