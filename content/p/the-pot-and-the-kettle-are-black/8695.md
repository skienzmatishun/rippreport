 We all need many 24 hr curfews from our Council!!! I can’t stand the 2 hours that I had to spend  each week with the sorry liars to begin with. I can see why some (very few thank God) people turn their lives around and lie and steal from the good people of Fairhope. They have caught BBBvirus.  And I’m not joking nor am I am laughing either!!!
