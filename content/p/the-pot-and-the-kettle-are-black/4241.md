 I don't see the degree of hypocrisy that you do. The only people who have given me good evidence of their true character are the ones who are so quick to judge. I do watch the meetings and see none of the stuff you see. Sure I see arguing, blaming, and complaining (from the Mayor also) but I do not see what you see. I might add that I seldom if ever seen the 3 junior members act rudely. I am not saying I agree with everything they say or do but right now I would believe them before some of the posters here. (See my previous post)
