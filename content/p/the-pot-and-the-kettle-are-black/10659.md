 Thanks for your service Ripp! The Vietnam experience was definitely a defining point of my life. Volunteered for the draft at 17 and honorably discharged at 19 years old. In my opinion much of what is happening today is a direct result of those who spit on us and sided with the our enemy are the ones who have helped bring our nation to verge of communism. There's just to much to the whole Vietnam story to discuss it in one comment. I respectfully disagree that the all the protestors were just Presidential (Trump) supporters. Many were antifa types and have been arrested, with more to come. The types the Bit#h Jane Fonda supports. And, I'm still waiting to water her grave!
