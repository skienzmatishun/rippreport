 Apsolutley an awesome statement. I've never been around Tripp Pittman when he wasn't lying and I've never been around Jack Burrell when he wasn't drunk. Without a doubt. I've have hundreds!!!! that agree with me. Especially at fundraisers. Wish they would just stay at home and let us enjoy our fundraisers that we all work so hard on.
