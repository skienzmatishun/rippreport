 Here is the run down:

1. Jay ROBinson.
Lawyer. Thinks he's smart. Lazy.
Doesn't know law. Has been caught thinking he's smart, being lazy and pretending to know law. Is not running to concentrate on "practicing."

2. Jay CONyours. 
The banker. Pretends neutral. Cuts sweet loans for builders ruining Fairhope. Likely the least corrupt, but corrupt. Not seeking re-election due to professional courtesy stemming from too numerous bank complaints.

3. Daddy Boone. The trailer park slumlord. Son of his runs the failing machine. Gets a piece of every check cut by the city via kickback, bribe and payoff. Not running for re-election as voters and feds now aware of the criminal enterprise his extended family runs.

4. ROB Brown. From your hometown. Farts in the general direction of voters. Crass. Rude. Obnoxious. Fake Christian act down pat. Has built a mansion with ill gotten gains. All in 4 short years. Not running to avoid divorce.

5. JACK Burrell. Miss. State grad who dubiously lists his occupations as engineer and "sales". Has remained council President for 6 long years. Enjoys quiet gulley strolls and ridiculing and teasing the mayor,a person he is jealous of. 

The only one of the 5 corrupt cretins intending to perpetuate the multi-decade fraud.

Prediction: So goes Burrell's impressive opponent...so goes Fairhope.
