 Brown, Burrell, Pittman, Elliot, etc. By running and fronting on as a Christian and bible thumper is a sin by God’s own words. Theses have shammed and disgraced and made me sick to my stomach everytime they stand on the roof pronouncing what a Christian they are. These guys lie everytime they open their mouth because they had to cover the previous lie they just spat out. Elliott still tells people he didn’t get a DUI (lie) and even Jack Burrell says he never has had a run in with the law. (Lie) Pittman, hell is and has proven that he is just ignorant (damn Truth) That’s my facts for this month. Brown, who cares! It’s all catching up with him a warp speed. No true Christians in this bunch and they are headed up by the anti-Christ Tucker Dorsey!  Everyone knows that. No proof needed.
