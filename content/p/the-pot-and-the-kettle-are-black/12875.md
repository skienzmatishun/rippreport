 Paul, so very right in congress persons and their family members serving in uniform.  Government is also very slow in admitting to and caring for veterans exposed to chemicals, as I was also exposed to in Vietnam and Camp Lejeune. Oh, that is the guy who knocked a woman off the bar stool, interesting.
