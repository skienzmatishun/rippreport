 That is why these council"men" ran- not to serve the city but to serve THEMSELVES.
Just look at the make up of the council.  We have developers, bankers, and lackeys beholding to Corte.
If the voters cannot see this then they DESERVE to have the town overcrowded and taxes go up while seeing Mobile Bay turn into a cesspool.  This goes for Daphne as well.
But enough people aren't saying anything.  These "public servants" are betting  that the people who are supposed to vote are too busy with everyday life that they will not look and see what the local politicians are doing.
Meanwhile Corte and the council are wheeling and dealing and selling us out on the cheap.
