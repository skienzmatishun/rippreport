 One thing I have noticed lately from the Fairhope "blue blood" crowd--those who think their "sh*t" don't stink--is that the new mayor is "crazy" and we need to get rid of her!

What is wrong with you people? We got rid of Tim Kant and you want to go back? Y'all are like the dysfunctional wife who gets beat by her husband and keeps taking him back after he goes to jail!!! Jesus H. Christ wake up! Our city is now considered "has been." Ask around. Our best days are behind us thanks to the goobs.
