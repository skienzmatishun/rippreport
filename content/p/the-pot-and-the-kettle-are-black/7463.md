 As I recall, Robert Brown was opposed to the Fly Creek Apartments while he was trying to win a Council seat. After we elected him to help put an end to that development, he voted totally in support of Corte and the apartments.  I believe he stated that Corte had been his mentor and that he (Brown) would always support him and didn't care what anyone else thought.  
Imho, that makes it very difficult to believe that Brown could ever put the well-being of Fairhope above that of Corte.  I hate it because he could have been an effective leader if he didn't have such a massive conflict of interest.  I don't think that he is necessarily a horrible person but he sold us out before and will probably do it again.
