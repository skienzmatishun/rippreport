 So Trip gets the hurricane debris removal contract in fairhope...after the bids were made...it's a multi-million dollar contract that kicks in in the event of a hurricane. Trip will just sub the whole thing out and keep the rest...a nice tidy profit. He then brings bags of cash to the council members...and there you have it...that's how public bidness is done in fairhope.
