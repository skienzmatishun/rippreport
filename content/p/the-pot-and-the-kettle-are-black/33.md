 How can Dist 2 "report" an 80 percent turnout when the rest of the Districts reported only 20 percent.   As a computer science major from Auburn (War Eagle!) it is too easy to manipulate the ROM modules.   All it takes is to look at the number of the signature sheets to see if over 800 people REALLY  voted unless the papers were destroyed.
