District one, North Baldwin County, has been Mr Burt’s turf for 28 years and the well connected in his district have been richly rewarded. He is the political dinosaur of the county and the epitome of the good ole boys.

District one is the site of the infamous mega site that cost us 35 million, plus the lost opportunity of the money.

This is going to be a very interesting race as the Catalyst group has selected Mr Burt’s replacement, Jeb Ball.

Mr Ball is the director of Baldwin County Substance Abuse, BCSA, this infamous LLC was formed by Judges and Lawyers. He is a Catalyst candidate “selected” to replace Burt. BCSA was founded by Judge Michell Thomason, among others, she also was the first client of Catalyst after their name change from Elliott Haygood and Stacy, those names should sound familiar. Many are asking if Mr. Ball was successful in defeating Mr Burt, would he resign from BCSA. Many conflicts of interest are apparent but hell this is Baldwin County what’s a little conflict of interest if it serves the connected few?

Do not be surprised if Mr Burt drops out for health reasons or maybe decides to retire, AFTER qualification. That would give Mr Ball no opposition and deny the voters the opportunity of choice.

Do not underestimate Catalyst, they will do whatever is necessary to insure that they have a commissioner’s seat in their pocket.

Pay Attention the games are about to begin.
