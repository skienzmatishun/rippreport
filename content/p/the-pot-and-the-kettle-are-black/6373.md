 I do not like the present Catalyst Cancerous Council who are arrogant towards the people.  I have lived here all my life and my ancestors came here with the Single-taxers and I am going to vote these carpet-bagging crooks out.
They have moved in this town that we helped build and convinced themselves and outsiders it was they who built this town.  Now they have sold this town to the outside developers, crowded our schools, overflowed our sewers, polluted our bay, jammed our roads, and brought in crime.
Don't tell me Robert Brown is from this "Hometown."  I just threw up in my mouth thinking about this bull.  He cashes in on any deal and moves to Rock Creek and takes his money with him.
This council MUST go baqck to where they came from.
