 Agreed. But we have one employee with Jack at just the right time. Also agree. The Mayor should have fired all those bitches the first day. They would not have a leg to stand on just as they shouldn't have a reason now. Proves that they and they family members have always screwed the City of Fairhope. People don't realize that sometimes. We also need to get rid of that dumb ass box of rocks that pour piss out of a boot with the directions in the heel. She is making 50 or 60 grand for being a knot in the log.
