 Those of us who have to be around them can see for a fact how they abuse the Word of God!  We unfortunately have to see and hear exactly what some of these officials say. We are not deaf nor dumb. Those politicians who publicly give God their word and then fail to keep it. They are not true Christians otherwise they would realize their own words are being ripped off. Their enemy is their own shallow character. Certainly a fact that you must not know yourself and/or definitely do not have to spend anytime around some of these politicians who are just Bible Thumping individuals that any Christian would not tolerate whatsoever unless it was part of their job. Just watch the Fairhope City Council Meetings on line and you will see just how terrible these men act and show their personalities and noncommittal attitudes towards making Fairhope a better place. Better yet, why donâ€™t you come to a meeting and see for yourself just how bad it is. I agree with you about some of the comment are mean. But, I can tell you that calling out any politician in Baldwin County for being a Hippocrate whi is telling us all what true Christians they are is certainly worth calling out. Men who prove their integrity are held in admiration and great respect. Most of these men have never had any integrity to begin with and they certainly have not gained any since being elected. Come to a meeting!!!
