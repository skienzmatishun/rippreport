 Jester is no longer amusing or entertaining.  He's tedious and boring, repeating the very same things over and over again.  Plus he feels compelled to throw in his two cents worth on every single other comment on any post, repeating his lies as though he still has something worthwhile to contribute.  It's bad enough knowing who he is in real life but his continuous tirades do nothing but make him look more and more foolish.  Please...just go away.
