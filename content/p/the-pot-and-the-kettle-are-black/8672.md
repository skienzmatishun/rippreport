 I do agree with Brownâ€™s comment about the Nuevo carpet baggers 
There are some people who have moved in here thinking that they are better than us locals.   I have known to tell a few of these people to go back to their sh@t holes such as California, New York, and Illinois
I have been to these places and I know how trashed they are.  I see these people as refugees 
It is too bad that Brown has sold out to them
