 My comment was mostly focused on the "locked the front doors" comment. That was same as last municipal election. Doubt you are will to say Coach Yelding was dirty too (he wasn't). As far as district 2 I have heard this as well. Should be easy to check. If there is fraud I'm not sure you could prove who was involved. But it would definitely cast doubt on the results.
