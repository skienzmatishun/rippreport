 Like Jack Burrell?  He’s a carpetbagging fool from hell and some of the slime treats him like he was born and raised here and the city is named after his parents. We do have a lot of this going on. I agree with Brown also except he does not qualify to make any good judgments about serving the people unless it puts money in his pocket. Both Burrell and Brown do not have the City’s best interests on their minds. Simply what can Fairhope do for them!! Brown, you been to gully lately?
