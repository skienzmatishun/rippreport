 Legislate is just another word for Steal or Take when it comes the Fairhope City Council or even the single Tax! Oh, forgive me please. Single tax pulled out of the Gulley project as not to show that they are totally stupid enough to fight 2000 plus citizens and Brown got pissed off becuse he probably already had some money tied up in the project. Bet???
