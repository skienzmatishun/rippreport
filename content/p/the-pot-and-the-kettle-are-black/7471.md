 Qualridge, we do not expect a poverty oath - just don't let "Christian greed" be an excuse to lie and steal in the name of "Christian."  
I am sick and tired of hearing "Christian," "Conservative," and "Christian Conservative."  I know this is what Catalyst tells them to say because these words poll well at election and seeing these guys in a church on Sundays makes for good photo ops, but too many of see through this.
Remember that Jesus forgave the sinners but chastised the hypocrites who wanted to be seen in public as "religious."
