 The city has been run for the rich and powerful forever. Poor whites and the disenfranchised gentry class are too being snubbed by the Fairhope elite. Problem is the elite can't rig the elections anymore. Mr. Ripp put a stop to that this last time.  I see the little people coming together to take out the elites that have hurt the city for money in their pockets. My two cents.
