 If You Don’t Know - Vote No.....

Now that is about as logical as the current council! 
Baaaaaad idea to not think for yourself!
                               ? 
I’d hate to know that I was a sheep! ? 

If you don’t VOTE YES, nothing will change. The challenging, infighting to remain in power,  being ugly and devisiveness will only continue. 

         A Vote for Yes is a Vote for Civility
