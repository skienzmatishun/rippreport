 Y'all don't understand how this here works. The politicians make it easy for their friends who finance their campaigns and give them the juice from the projects. 

Repeat. Read it again.

The clock is ticking in Fairhope. As the county overbuilds around it, the quality of life is slowly zapped. Nobody wants to sit in traffic and for their kids to sit in trailers all day long. Kinda sad that fairhope high is a trailer park high school. And we dump raw sewage in the bay. I just don't get it people.

If you put the same council in next time Fairhope is doomed because karin has slowed it down. The county planning office is doing nothing to stop growth. The great money grab of baldwin county circa 2020 is in full effect...environment, quality of life, property values, traffic commute times be damned! Every land owner for himself! 

This ain't gonna end well folks.
