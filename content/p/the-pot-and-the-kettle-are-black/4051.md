 Baldwin County Substance Abuse is a scam set up by Michelle Thomason and others on the bench. It requires dui offenders to take drug ed classes and take drug tests--even though they got a dui and not a drug offense. Then it has to all be paid in cash. You heard it here first. They only take cash. Wonder why?
