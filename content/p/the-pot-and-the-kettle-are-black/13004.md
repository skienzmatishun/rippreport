 I’m only familiar (very familiar that is) about the Steve Nodine subject matter, therefore I’ll limit my post to only that subject.  Steve Nodine deserves everything he got just simply the way he treated other people each and every day. He was a menace and acted in horrible ways which included breaking the law along with constantly acting out with what he thought was his POWER over individuals each and everyday.  I can assure you that he got off lightly compared to the crimes he committed while bullying each and every person he could on a daily basis. Rotten to the core!  Upset people everyday he was breathing. Now you go ahead and post about how YOU think he was mistreated but I can assure you that he should never be allowed in a public position for his remaining days on this earth and should never have a position in any company where he has any authority whatsoever.  This is not just my opinion but the true opinion of many others. One day I’ll just have to share about the way we all feel after being treated like crap by no other than “Steven Nodine”! Did not proof this. It was all I could do to get it down without puking.
