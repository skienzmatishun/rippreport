 Preaching to the choir!  Every single person in Fairhope understands what's happening here.  The fired employees, as well as Pandora (who her co-workers say never did nor does now a lick of work though was paid as though she had an actual responsible job)  are long-time buddies of Jack and Jack covers the asses of all his friends, regardless of what they've done.  Never has the the ugly side of politics been so abundantly clear as with the Council of this administration.  Settling lawsuits has been a mainstay of business-as-usual in Fairhope throughout the Kant reign and now the Council is keeping the status quo.  Shoving money at their friends works in all kinds of ways for them.  They pay off their buddies while at the same time making it appear that the Mayor did something wrong when she absolutely did NOTHING wrong.  As was her prerogative, she fired employees for cause - or without cause - doesn't matter! - it was her right to do so.  No where else would any fired employee in Alabama have a leg to stand on.

On another note, how nice was it that Jack was gone for the last Council meeting?  The work session was zippy and the Council meeting flowed without his constant inane interruptions.  I wish he'd be gone for every Council meeting.
