 So some friends in Fairhope were talking the senate race. A couple told me they were voting for Trip because they were "alright with Trip." 
I asked them what this meant. They said they didn't believe the tripe spread about him, and were voting and praying for him. I was kinda upset. I know Trip is not a Christian. I argued with them but I got nowhere. Then I found out that they were actually related to Trip and that they had to "keep it in the family." It all made perfect sense. SMH.
