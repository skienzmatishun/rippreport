 Hello Anonymous
I've watched the video links you provided several times. And you're correct as far as those particular videos go. However, there have been other videos that have been released that show additional evidence of nefarious, if not criminal activity. I only seek the truth, which many times is elusive. Always good to look at all evidence to help discern.
