 This coronavirus may not end up being as bad as we had thought (it’s still bad)  but I know Jack and he was determined to have the Art Festival as scheduled. Why in the hell would anyone in this community actually support this kind of behavior and poor decision making unless they as well as Jack are all profiting from us. Can you actually believe there are people who supported his idea even days after the Governor closed the schools until possibly fall.  How stupid can you be to support this unless you are just f$&amp;king that greedy that you don’t mind putting our wonderful community at risk. All of you assholes will burn in hell. The sooner, the better. You Burrell supporters as well!  Damn, y’all supporters are just plain idiots!  Respond how you wish you catalyst assholes. I don’t give a F about stupidity and neither should the REAL caring  people of Fairhope!
