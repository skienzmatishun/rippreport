 My Opinion TODAY, It is a long time,two and half years till the next election. Burrell and Boone made terrible decisions in the last administration that are impacting us now. Sewer, infrastructure,Fly Creek, soccer fields and the triangle. Jack's Airport shenanigans will do him in. Be sure to watch his new deal. He and Boone also had to "Settle" the triangle lawsuit, since then they have tried to portray the "settlement" as a purchase for a park, total bs. Burrell will not win re-election Boone I understand is standing down.

Brown will be lucky to serve his whole term.

Conyers may not run again, The biggest reason being his job and conflicts.

Robinson may be the lone survivor

The Mayor will be re elected, if she seeks another term. One way or another she will have transformed Fairhope to a more transparent Government. Her hires far exceed the previous administration. Corruption will be reduced because she broke the Fairhope connection to the good ole boys, that's why they are fighting so hard to regain control of Fairhope.
