 L.D. Sleigh. You wouldn’t know what a Christian is if Jesus himself walked up to you. There is no jealousy here. First place it’s a sin and second, these thieves are the one pronouncing that they all are Christians. If they truly were?  They would be known as Christians by example. It’s a sin what they are doing. Jealous you say. You need the Bible. This is all facts. Try treading it. Might do you some good. Billy Graham was a True Christian!  These men are not!!!!
