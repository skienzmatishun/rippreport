 Ripp,
I just wish the tempers would calm down.   Politicians on BOTH sides are working the American people.  The news is either far right or far left.  They got us Americans fighting each other over ideologies that are hurting BOTH sides.
I do not think the Federal Government was supposed to be this powerful.  As people fight more and more, they are giving the government more power to control our lives.
I say that BOTH sides back off, look at each other as fellow Americans and see just how much we actually have in common.
If we give the government power while our people are in power then that same power transfers to the next people that get in power whether you like those people or not.
China, Russia, Iran, North Korea are just laughing it up to see a mighty military power break down internally and the military power beign used against our own people.
