 I have lived in this town since 1968.  I bought my house in the Fruit and Nuts for just over 15,000.  It is now worth over $450,000.  I am selling out and moving out of this town.  I am going to the country out of the city limits and police jurisdiction of Fairhope.
It is sad to see these people ruining this town - but I will cry all the way to the bank.
