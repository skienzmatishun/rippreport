 Was at Julwin's the other day. Why do so many old geezer fairhopians blame mayor Karin for the city's growth problems? This is the fault of the council, not the mayor! 

The leader of the council, "Mr. Diddy" Jack Burrell, is your problem. Him and that nasty catalyst council!!! Wake up our town is being overrun. Do you really think Fairhope will be the same in five years?  It will be a mess.

Stop the growth until new roads and schools are built. Please.
