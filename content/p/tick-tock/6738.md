 I am from Fairhope, lived here all my life - 70 plus years &amp; it is more than ridiculous these "newcomers to Fairhope" who have moved here &amp; think they are something special.  How funny!!!  Fairhope is NOTHING like it use to be - all these people that have moved in have totally DESTROYED Faiehopw!!
It is more than sickening!!   Those that have moved here that think they are now something special - believe you me - we know who you are &amp; you are NOT !!!'
