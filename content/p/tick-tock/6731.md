 So what if it destroys Fairhope?   Money will be made.  The citizens of Fairhope donot care.   They just want to walk around town, sip wine, and tell themselves they live in Fairhope without having to think that the town will end up as a traffic-jammed, over-priced, over-taxed, over-crowded, and OVER-RATED place.
This is because of the political machine named Catalyst and paid for by DR Horton, Belaton, and  people  named Stacey and Cox.
