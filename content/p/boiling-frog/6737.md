 This comment is more than a bit misleading.  Robert Brown is a partner in Pitman-Brown, a very respected building contractor.  Whatever PB made off of the ESAC remodel surely has nothing to do with Robert Brown's personal home.  He can probably well afford to build anything he wants any place that he wants. I agree that he is very arrogant on the Council, but libel is less attractive than arrogance.
