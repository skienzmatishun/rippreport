 A lot of the “minorities” you mention are families that have lived here and worked for generations 
Now they are being squeezed out
Don’t think you can keep who you don’t like out of here.  I did not want the Yankees here but I had to live with it and learned to like it 
Now how I wish it was just Yankees
