 Pittman Brown should never have been involved with the Art Center contract,Brown is a Councilman and a Board member of the Art Center a clear conflict of interest and Pittman is his partner and director of Single Tax who had inside information on the contract amounts, there was no BID PROCESS, still a valid complaint that may see the light of day, very soon.
