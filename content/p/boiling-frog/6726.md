 I heard the Jester buiding his dream home on our dime.

In police work, we call this a CLUE.

Jester is none other than councilman Robert Brown.

The money for this excessive structure on a questionable location came from renovations ti the arts center done by his company, voted on by the Arts Center board of directors.

The Jester is a board member.

Silly Fairhope.

You will always be like Oz.

Free yourself.

Pull back the curtain!!
