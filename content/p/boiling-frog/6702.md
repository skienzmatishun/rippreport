 I see the wonderful mayor and planning commission and council in Robertsdale has taken a page out of the Fairhope playbook.  You think the Eastern Shore has sewer overflow problems, Robertsdale is worse.  They are siding with developers and not the citizens on new housing to put on this already dinosaur over flowing sewer problem.  The King here doesn't care about the people just do as I say and take it. Debt close to 28 million just bring him money so he can spend.
