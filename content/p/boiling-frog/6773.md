 You may be correct but perhaps PB won the contract because they did it for a fair price and they do excellent work.  I don't know Cliff Pitman personally but have had business interactions with him and I would trust him 100 percent (which is why I trust Robert Brown).  There are a lot of shoddy contractors out there, particularly with commercial work.  I think that the City avoided a lot of problems by hiring PB.  Too bad the library was built by someone else!
