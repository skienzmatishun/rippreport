The Eastern Shore was blessed that Hurricane Michael spared us. Please pray for those in the storm’s path and if you have the opportunity to donate time or items for those impacted from the storm, it will be greatly appreciated.

Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.

Electing Chris Elliott for State Senate Seat 32, is insanity, nothing will change. Mr Elliott has already spent in excess of 600,000 thousand dollars in his campaign. He owes so many people that he will not be able to have an original thought. The Sheriff’s office, Eddie Tyler, Baldwin County School Superintendent, and Mayors Craft and Kennon, and Gumbo, all have a piece of Elliott.

Check out Elliott’s special contributors.

Chris is taking the Kay Ivy approach for the general election, hide and count on straight ticket voting. Mr. Elliott’s campaign material, print and media, is so hypocritical that it defies common sense. Straight ticket voting is insanity.

October 11th, tomorrow night, Jason Fisher will be at the Fairhope Castle for a campaign event. Their will be food, drink, drones and the candidate. Please come and listen to Jason Fisher running for State Senate Seat 32.
