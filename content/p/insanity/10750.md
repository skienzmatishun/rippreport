 Baloney,
The Christian Conservatives will keep being elected because CSB tells them that being a christian concervative (whatever that means) polls well.  The voters here in Baldwin are too busy working two jobs to pay for their DR Horton houses that are overpriced for the cheap materials that are put in them.  Besides, they are told they are buying into "Paradise."
Paradise will soon collapse as the subdivisions overwhelm the area.
Hey folks: notice how the stores are always understocked in Daphne and Fairhope?  That is because all the new people are overwhelming the stores and the stores cannot keep the shelves stocked.   It is not all COVID.  Ask a stock person at Walmart.
 Wait until you have a medical emergency and cannot get into Thomas Hospital.  The local leaders need to be charged with criminal offenses for putting the people at such a risk.  They are part of the problem.
