 I could not agree more. Chris Elliott is toxic and his veins of evil reach all over Baldwin County and corrupt Alabama politics.  I have only recently relocated to Alabama and, had I known then what I know now, I would have never moved to Baldwin County.  I have never seen so many clueless people let corruption sell them down the river.  Tucker Dorsey was shut down and he was only Elliott's proxy.
