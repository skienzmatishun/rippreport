 Jason, you have my vote - but you MUST distance yourself from the national Democrats.  You may be a liberal but the conservatives here in Baldwin County will vote for the person who calls himself a "Conservative Christian" every time.
Your opponent who is really an opportunist and not a "Conservative" has taken ownership of the "Christian Conservative" label which polls well here in this county.  His campaign manager, Mr. Gray, knows this.
