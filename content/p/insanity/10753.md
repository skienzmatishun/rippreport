 So if Walmart is so adjustable then how do you explain the empty shelves?   I am not talking about just toilet paper but rather the entire store:  Soups, milk, cold cuts and cheese, soaps, and bread(which is baked locally) are very low.   It makes them look like a third world country.  
I am not blaming Walmart but the overpopulation of this area.
