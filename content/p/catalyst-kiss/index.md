The last Monday night Fairhope City Council meeting and the work session were unnecessary long. Many people have begun to watch the council meeting in their homes, on Youtube. It is convenient and you can moot the council president, when you wish.

Council President Burrell has occupied his position for 7 plus years, never sharing the gavel with other councilman. He has to have control and he never, ever, ever, shuts up, except when you ask him about his Police Report, then he gets real quiet.

Monday’s meetings was a classic example of diarrhea mouth in action. Watch the video, if you can. The council meeting was extended by 30 minutes or more with Jack talking about every subject. He spent 10 minutes making excuses about agenda mistakes and saying he was sorry to the folks who showed up for the canceled item.

Burrell showed his true colors when he threw a KISS to Bill Hightower, in the audience, a CATALYST candidate for the First Congressional District. The Fairhope CATALYST council will run as a block vote in 2020 and they only support and promote CATALYST candidates, that is why Bill got a kiss.

Bill Hightower has thrown in with the most corrupt good ole boys in Baldwin County, CATALYST. The council is being run like a criminal enterprise and a vote for good ole Bill is a vote for CATALYST.

Folks the last thing Baldwin County needs is a CATALYST Congressman.

A vote for Bill Hightower is a vote for CATALYST
