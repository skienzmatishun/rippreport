Mid-Term elections are less than 60 days away. Is Baldwin County going to elect the Catalyst good ole boy, who is bought and paid for, just because he is republican? That is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different outcome, that’s insanity.

A vote for Elliott is a vote for CATALYST.

Elliott just barely squeaked by the better republican candidate, David Northcutt, by only 742 votes. Northcutt was NOT a Catalyst candidate. In the end Elliott pulled every dirty trick he could muster, the fact that he won by such a slim margin, speaks volumes about his credibility and Catalyst.

Let’s not forget those good ole christian values.

Best yet don’t forget the “behind closed door penny tax”

A lot of republicans and independents are going to vote for Jason Fisher, the better candidate. Let’s get off the insanity track and do something different. The State Senate Seat 32, in the past, has been a joke and the people of Baldwin County paid the price. Let's not make the same mistake again.

Investigate Mr. Jason Fisher, come meet him and listen to his vision for Baldwin County. Vote for the better candidate not the party.
