 Sherry is a Catalyst sellout. I see her signs in the yards with Boone and Burrell and Brown
Last election there were the same signs and Wilson still won
If Wilson wins Boone Consulting aka Catalyst will be more of a joke than it already is.   Hightower paid Catalyst lots of money to buy the election and still list
Having Baby Boone running your election is like having him run a one bedroom brothel with the lights left on.   He will still find a way to still f**k it up even if you help him find it
