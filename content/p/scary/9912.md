 I don't think that Grand Membership is cleared up with the voters.  Most voters don't like people who steal.  I have a few extra rooms at my house.  Think I might rent them out and make some money for my "family membership".  Also, if the Mayor and sister wife and family only lived together, obviously closely, for 1 year, then why did their "family membership" last for so many years?
