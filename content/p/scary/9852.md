 To bash John Manelos simply because he was an employee of BP is ridiculous. Was he on the Deepwater Horizon?  No. Was he in a position to make safety decisions about the operations of the Deepwater Horizon?  No. If you have nothing better to bash him about, then you should just stick with facts and let the intelligent people of Fairhope make their own decisions.  Your Ripp Report is just as biased as CNN, Fox News, and all of the others. Apparently unbiased journalism is dead in our society.
