 Ripp,
Don't bother answering this question about a pool membership that goes back a generation.
Geez, this is all the Catalysts can find on Karin - even if it is doubt-able.
Dear Catalysts, just listen to yourselves:  She used the Lakewood pool back in 1997, or was it 1996?   Whaaaa!     Catalysts have stolen millions with their backroom deals and dirty tactics and all they can find is something about using the Lakewood pool?
You guys are desperate.
