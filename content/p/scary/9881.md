 No, I am not from Portland  or Seattle.  I am from Fairhope.  Born and bred.  I am sick of seeing my town ruined by the developers.  They have made us Fairhopers second class citizens in our kiwi home town
You can call this hate speech all you want but we had to move out of our town because they drove up our property taxes
But you say that they are Christians and I say they are hypocrites
