 Do the math for me please.  You have been here for 8 years.  You say Fairhope has more than doubled twice in that time.  Let's see.  We will use 22,000 as the Fairhope population today.  Divide by 2, and you get 11,000.  Ok, now it doubled twice you say.  So, 11,000 divided by 2 and now you have 5,500! That was the population of Fairhope in the late 60's to early 70's.  And you say this happened in 8 years.  Apparently they did not teach truth or math at your previous address.
