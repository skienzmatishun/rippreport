 Mr. Ripp. And yes I used that term loosely. While listing the current Mayor’s accomplishments, you missed one or two!  Maybe using police department funds illegally to hire Elias Technologies to spy on city employees. Maybe physically shaking a city employee and then firing that person. But I digress. Maybe the mayor was telling the truth. She didn’t shake a city employee physically. The mayor was at the Grand Hotel pool using her and her twin sisters illegal duel membership. So, if the mayor didn’t do it, it must have been her twin sister while filling in as mayor. Oh, and of course the mayors husband didn’t sit in the audience at a council meeting and shoot the “good ole boy” bird to the person speaking at the podium. I can’t remember, did you report on that?  Well, the mayor can’t lie her way out of her husbands actions. That new camera thingy captured it all.
