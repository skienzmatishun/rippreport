 I know that you are a big Karin supporter (and I have always believed that her heart is in the right place), but you appear to be  actively trying to get Sherry Sullivan elected.  You must know that Mayor Wilson doesn't have a snowball's chance in hell of being re-elected.  The City Council has treated her horribly but she has alienated so many former supporters by being blamed (through no fault of her own) for the apartments and the runaway development here.  Most voters only remember that she campaigned to stop Fly Creek Apartments and the out-of-control growth; even though she tried her best to fulfill her promises, she is still the one that is blamed, not our coin-operated Council.   Please stop trashing John Manelos, who does have Fairhope's best interests at heart also before you just toss the entire thing to Sullivan.  There is no way that Mayor Wilson will get many votes this year because of her poor 'people skills' and combative attitude (again, I don't quite blame her for that but our Mayor should be someone that can calmly deal with opposing opinions and help reach consensus).  You &amp; she should both acknowledge the contributions that Mr. Manelos could make before you ask people to elect one of her biggest enemies.
