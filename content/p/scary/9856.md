 The BP guy on the paddle board is working with Jack Burrell. Burrell has a police record, been involved in multiple alcohol related incidents, bid rigging and back room deals he is the worst council person to serve in 25 years.How about the FEDERAL FREE SPEECH lawsuit Jack and the council lost.The BP guy is on a sinking paddle board. As far  as the Mayor's chances, may I remind you that in the 2018 election we knocked out several CATALYST candidates. In 2016 we knocked out Cant. and just recently won the congressional seat with Jerry Carl. I suggest that you not go to Windcreek. Wake up High School education, fired disgruntled employee, sued the city and conspired with council to undermine the duly elected Mayor, little experience. Oh yes and past employees of Scary Sherry are saying Hell No.
