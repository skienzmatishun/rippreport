 Is it possible that Burrell, Boone, and Brown told Sullivan not to attend the Mayoral forum so she wouldn’t have to answer any questions? Is it possible that the entire thing was planned to have her at the game while all others were at the forum being held accountable? If I wanted a candidate elected that would have no power and was not savvy enough to debate I would tell them to do the same. I feel sorry for her that she doesn’t realize she’s being used as a pawn. The inability to be angered by being treated as though you aren’t sophisticated enough to debate is an indicator of the inability to run a city. I’m not necessarily a Pro Karin but am Anti Sherry at this point.
