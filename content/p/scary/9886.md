 Georgia,
Electing Sherry is like electing the fox to care for the hen house.  Electing Manelos is like electing a useful idiot to guard the gates
Karin is not perfect but she has had to fight the council, the crookedness, and the deep state all at the same time
She started out trusting and naive but had to learn fast about the evils of Catalyst
She has had to be tough and this one person has had to stand up against the Catalysts, Kant’s political machine, and the home builders.   Wilson has grown a thick skin and has proven herself
She has more strength than the rest of the bullies
I admire Karin and I am spreading the word to the town.  All the cheap PVC signs won’t stand up to the truth
