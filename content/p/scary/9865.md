 Catalyst is sooooo on the line here.   They put in faux candidate Manelos to force a runoff.  They are really desperate to get Karin out of office
I hope the  Three B’s lose and Wilson wins.   If so, Catalyst will be neutralized until the next election.   The home builders will be let known that they don’t own this town and the people will be able to live without being forced out 
 The Three B’s have grown arrogant and must be sent home
