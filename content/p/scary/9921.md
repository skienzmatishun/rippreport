 Over 60% of the campaign money raised by Karen so far was from one developer Trussville Springs LLC out of Jefferson County. It was the largest single donation to any candidate by far.  See Baldwin County election/Probate records online.   REMFRANT'S own candidate is owned by developers.  What a coincidence.    No wonder nothing slowed down while crazy Karen has been in office.
