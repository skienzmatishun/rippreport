 Thanks to Ripp, Catalyst as a name has been exposed so much that Baby Boone had to rename it.   
But you can still see it in the form of the plastic pipe signs and see how the candidatesâ€™ signs are grouped together. When you see a Sullivan sign you will see a Boone sign, a Burrell sign, and  a Brown sign 
Now go up to Daphne and see the same plastic pipe signs and see those candidates that use Catalyst/Boone.
Catalyst birds of a feather flock together ....
