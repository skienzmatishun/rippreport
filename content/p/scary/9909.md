 Too bad the home builders were not assessed impact fees like they do in Mobile.  Do you think Catalyst which is funded by the local developers in financing campaigns of the Catalyst politicians had something to do with it too?
Wait!  Don't bother to answer that:  Catalysts do not answer the tough questions but rather ignore them .  But, as you can see, we have been getting you out of office one by one:
Tucker Dorsey
JOP race lost
Kant out
Haygood on his way out
and soon, the three B's will be out
Next, we are going back to the county commission and vote the Catalysts out of there as well.
You all can keep changing the name of the political machine but we will know who they are just by following the money from the builders to the politicians.
