 Sir, we natives of Fairhope were concerned about uncontrolled growth when you moved in. Please move back to where you imported yourself from. If you are truly concerned about to much growth, be a leader and start helping with the problem. That “black man” you refer to?  Apparently you don’t know he has a name. It is Corey Martin. Your bias is obvious on many levels. You, sir are a major part of Fairhope’s problems. Please lock the gate when you head back to wherever you came from. Thank you in advance.
