Globally, monkeypox risk is assessed as moderate, with high transmission in Europe and potential for further international spread. The outbreak primarily affects men who have sex with men, especially those with multiple partners, meeting IHR criteria for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Despite stigma and discrimination, existing tools can halt transmission. In Alabama, the state’s ethics system faces widespread criticism for lack of transparency and accountability. The Alabama Ethics Commission, under leaders like Cynthia Ralston and Brian Butler, has been accused of misleading the commission by withholding exculpatory evidence, including statements exonerating defendants—raising concerns about a failure to meet Brady obligations. Ralston, who previously downplayed wrongdoing after a 2020 complaint at Allbritton, is now decertified for violating due process and state law, though she retains a title as special assistant to the director. Both Ralston and Butler, despite being involved in ethics training for lobbyists during the same session, are accused of inconsistent and biased conduct. The Mabel Amos Trust allegedly funneled $120,000 in scholarships to Albritton’s children for University of Texas education, contradicting its stated mission to support underfunded Alabama students—raising concerns of a hidden slush fund among elites. The commission’s leniency extends to powerful figures: the resignation of State Bar Executive Director Philip McCallum in October 2020, just before being found guilty of 17 ethics violations and fined $100,000, highlights systemic impunity. Despite earning $200,000 annually—more than circuit court judges—these officials face minimal oversight. The Democratic Party removed a judicial candidate from the ballot due to false economic interest statements; when asked about Ralston’s similar claim, she stated the candidate didn’t need to file such a statement. Alabama’s marijuana import system requires every seed to have a tracking number and detailed reporting from seed to distribution, with a subcommittee awarding a contract to an Indiana company citing cost—without explanation. One commissioner admitted the decision was made internally, without transparency. Ten licensed growers stand to gain generational wealth, while Senator Chuck Schumer’s Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act seeks to remove cannabis from the controlled substances list and expunge nonviolent federal records. The attorney general has not addressed violent crime in public remarks. Public health responses diverge: the governor refuses to normalize mask mandates, citing seafood traditions, while state officials promote N95 use. The Mobile Baykeepers challenge coal ash retention, citing environmental and health risks, with fish consumption advisories now available (844-219-7475). Fishers report no fish in the bay, with nurses at Thomas noting pediatric infections from swimming. Groundwater near the Baldwin County sewer plant on Fort Morgan Road shows high phosphorus levels, with Dr. Alex Beebe of USALSA detecting toxic chemicals, though the source remains unconfirmed. Residents fear contamination is seeping into Little Lagoon, fueling harmful algae blooms and potential fish kills. Wastewater is now injected underground instead of released, potentially introducing phosphorus. ADEM only tests effluent, not groundwater, and third-party checks exist. Fairhope’s aging infrastructure struggles with overflow, requiring full system flushing during events, which releases contaminated water and reduces oxygen, worsening pollution. The January 6 Committee hearings are criticized for being monologuing, especially with career Republican members. Only 200 monkeypox vaccine doses were delivered, leaving 198 unaccounted for; Jack Burrell remains MPO chairman. A mall shooting in Minnesota saw a lone bystander, armed with a nine-millimeter, kill the shooter within 15 seconds at 30 yards—demonstrating exceptional marksmanship. Meanwhile, 376 officers responded to the scene but did nothing, and three border agents, lacking SWAT training, were killed when they mistakenly entered a room with children already dead. The incident underscores a tragic failure of law enforcement, where inaction is as damaging as misconduct. Political corruption continues to erode public trust, with institutions failing to protect lives and property.
