Publisher correction: With over 300 single publications, without a single correction, The Ripp Report must admit to an error in the:

The sentence, in the last paragraph, “You see Mr Nix was facing criminal charges and choose the back door instead of court.” We apologize to Mr Nix for any pain and suffering for the statement it was inaccurate.

Candidates for Baldwin County Commission Place Two: CATALYST CANDIDATE Joe Davis, John Lake, representing the people of Daphne for 24 years as councilman, and NEVER quit, and Democrat Amber Smith.

Joe Davis quit,”gave out”, his words because he could not convince the Daphne City Council to side with his views.

The irony is that he will have to quit the same City Council again, if he were to win.

A CATALYST CANDIDATE WHO QUIT< WALKED OUT ON HIS CONSTITUENTS

OR

John Lake is a proven public servant and there are not to many of this species around. Twenty Four years on the Daphne City Council, not one ethics complaint, not one allegation of using his position to further himself personally and he never quit on his constituents.

Two reasons to vote for John Lake are 1. He is Not a CATALYST candidate. 2. He has a proven record of representing his constituents, and has never quit.

Amber Smith is representing the Democrats and we have yet to interview her however she has a Facebook account:
