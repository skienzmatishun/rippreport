 <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e-iEBe7W26I" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>  Alabama has a history of corruption. Baldwin County has organized the corruption under the banner of CATALYST. The average citizen is oblivious to extent of the corruption until it winds up on their front door. Catalyst is not stupid only empowered by absolutely no accountability, legally, morally or ethical. Read Strawman , Lagniappe or past Ripp Report posts.
