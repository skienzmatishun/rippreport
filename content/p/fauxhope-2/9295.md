 I happen to to know for myself about the Daphne mayoral situation.  Ripp is spot on.
I personally knew Catalyst got a politician out of office by luring him to run for another office by having a developer contribute $5,000 for his campaign.   Then catalyst put another candidate in his old office. 
I know this outfit like the back of my hand. 
So you can refute this all you want but I know what Ripp is saying is true and you are a Catalyst liar
