 No, Ripp doesn’t delete posts that disagree with him.   Look at the Catalyst that keeps calling him a REMF. 
Also, why don’t you Catalysts get your own blog?  You know like the Baldwin Insider.    Chuckie had pretty good articles but he was too cowardly to sign his name like Ripp does
It would be wonderful to have a Catalyst Chronicle trying to explain their good ole boy deals and how they try to steal land and lie about it while still making an appearance in church to fool the masses
