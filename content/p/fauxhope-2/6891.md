 It is interesting that the Republican blamed the Democrats for having a "Tax and Spend" mentality.  Now that the Republicans are in power, taxing is all the Republicans can think of when they use to be the party of limited government and low taxes.
I guess the saying "Absolute power corrupts absolutely" applies here.
Democrats will tell you "It's for the Children," while Republicans will say, "It's for the infrastructure."
