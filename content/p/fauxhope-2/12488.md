 I agree.
This abridged Working Waterfront Plan certainly beats the britches off the original plan.
We say leave the bluff area alone.
We certainly do not need more traffic.
The traffic and loud vehicles are horrific. 
We are, however, strong supporters of the Mayor and Council.
This plan has been well advertised.
