 Every man I know in Fairhope did not vote for Moore ,or more accurately, of the men in Fairhope who told me whom they voted for, none voted for Moore. Guess it depends on who your friends are. BTW at least one man you know Georgia did not vote for Moore.  Frankly, while I think too many vote a straight ticket the fact that 97% of blacks voted Democratic is worse. I did not vote for Moore or Jones. I grant you Moore would have been worse than Jones but that is not saying a lot.
