 So if they delete posts they do not like then why did they not delete yours?
Hmmmm?
You Catalysts are really spinning trying to refute Ripp.  I know you guys are in major damage control.  I can not wait for the election when I ask Catalyst candidates why they are bought and paid for and do not care about the people.
You guys were hit hard the last election (Lost the JOP race, Clerk of Court, and Tucker) and you guys are now on the defense.
It use to be that Catalyst had a 100% win rate.  What happened?  People finding out? Poor management?  The voters seeing what you do once you are in office?
