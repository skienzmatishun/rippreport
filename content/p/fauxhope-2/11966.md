 This is like the Beverly Hillbillies on shrooms. God help Fairhope, a once beautiful, idylic Christian town.  Thank you for persistence in exposing corruption in our town. I moved here from outside Minneapolis three years ago and I sense a change in the place. I pray for our guided future. We need real Christian men representing us. A woman or two wouldn't hurt, either.
