 Well said.  I found it shocking that every man I know in Fairhope either voted for Moore or did not bother to vote because he could not vote for a Democrat (child sex predators are SO much more qualified to be lawmakers in our Nation's Senate).  All of the men ( and women) that I know in Vestavia &amp; Mountain Brook voted for Jones, and many of them and their wives even campaigned for Jones. 
There are lessons to be learned here......Roy Moore should use his charity to jet over to Libya to buy himself some slaves since that was the 'last time that America was great (paraphrased)'.
