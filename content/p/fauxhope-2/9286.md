 Catalyst is a smart and shrewd outfit.   When I saw where one of their operatives get on Facebook and bless the retired Colonel for Daphne Mayor I KNEW he was a Catalyst running for office.   A three way race with him, Haygood, and LeJeune would put Haygood back in office unless Lake gets in the race.  But I think he is running the Lake Forest POA
As far as Fairhope goes, who would run against any of the council.  I would support anyone to get these current guys out. You tell us who the good ones are and they will have my vote and I will campaign for them
As far as Spanish Fort goes, I am afraid that I would get slapped by someone in City  Hall up there
