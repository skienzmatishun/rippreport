 I want to move into Belaton so I can pay off the pool the Catalysts mortgaged so they could take money out of the development 
Not really
These people who are buying and over paying for these houses think they are so smart.  I say if you are smart then sue for your pool back
After these catalysts get big enough for their dirty dealings then maybe they will ease off their crooked ways 
Just ask Corte - he has to go bankrupt on one of his shady deals
