 vaccine bad because vaccine bad!!! Not the other ones I had in the past.  Vaccine baaaad!!!

Fun fact, if you cooked food on teflon, you got a nice dose of a chemical that mimics estrogen.  Except for it doesn't go away.  But they got rid of that right?  Know what happens when you used a scratched non stick cookware?  Yep, you guessed it, big dose of permanent estrogen.  Ever drink from a plastic bottle left out in the sun?  Estrogen.  Did you know girls have been going through puberty at a younger age?  Did you know that sperm count is down significantly among the youth?  Anyway, vaccine baaaaad!!  Regulation baaad!!!
