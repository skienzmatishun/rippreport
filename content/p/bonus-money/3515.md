 I guess you have not been around the block or you are just stupid. Both I would guess. Every well known news organization in Mobile and Baldwin Co have and will continue to file lawsuits, requested matierial using FOIA Ac. That would be Freedom Of Information Act to you who like to bash. I must say you bash behind the anonymous name very well. We also file ethics charges and complaints all the time. So shut your pie hole up. When you become a real citizen and have the correct knowledge. You will understand these things that you have been totally ignorant of. Ripp could care less if you bash him. Why don't you tell him who you are in the same breath, Coward. Do some research. You will still will be an idiot, but maybe a smarter idiot. It's an improvement believe it or not!
