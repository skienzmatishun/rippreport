 To the others that have bashed Anonymous, if there are any idiots on this board it is those that file ethics complaint after ethics complaint and they all get dismissed. I guess when you fail, continuously, and have zero credibility left in the community you change your company, Paul's in clearly out of business.

The only city government official that has hired a criminal defense attorney is the mayor! Oops!
