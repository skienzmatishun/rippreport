 I would like to know as well. Either way. Also, no one fired this year should be entitled to any money whatsoever!!!  Insurance payment or city funds. We citizens should have a clear understanding and the Mayor should have certainly been a part of the decision to settle or not settle any of these claims whether you like her or not. Something smells fishy. We have the right to know all the facts. This is our town dammit!!!
