 Filing a lawsuit to obtain information when an FOIA request is declined is proper, filing ethics complaints when you claim to be a news organization is not. Again, this blog was supposed to be a site to share ideas but I guess when you don't have a good argument so you call individuals names. If you read the last sentence it will indicate that "I was not trying to bash." Ripp himself has stated 'The Ripp Report" was considered a news organization by the ABA, maybe a dysfunctional news organization but that is what he claimed. Why would Ripp change his corporation, news organizations do not contribute money for political reasons. I have read all the articles of incorporation, among other material. I do great research, actually, that is what 
I do, perhaps you need to learn how to do research. I guess this site is run by Jester or Truthteller now, someone did say 'group."
