 Seriously, have you not heard of the rise in popularity of boutique hotels worldwide over the past decade, or are you just taking a swipe at the Mayor and her family because they want the best for Fairhope?  The Marriott is wonderful but a lot of people like to stay downtown and the Hampton is always full.  It would be the best thing for that location IMHO!
