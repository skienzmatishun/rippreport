Jack Burrell is like a pop up target. He is involved in one controversy after the other. The newest “sketchy and secretive” project is the K-1 Center. I eluded to it in the last post under B.

Hard to tell what the truth is these days but some information leaking out, if true, will set Fairhope’s hair on fire. A. Jack Burrell denied, on WACO radio, any party was held at his house. He…

The council, led by Jack have been discussing, in private and in secrete meetings, plans for the K-1 Center. Jack, without disclosing anything with the public, wrote a letter of intent to the School Board. The Mayor nor the public have been informed about any details or letter of intent.

The council wants to keep this under wraps and eliminate any competitive projects from public view. This is the kind of crap the council and council president have been doing for two years.

The Citizens of Fairhope deserve to see what other options have been submitted. The below article is the first public coverage of what appears to be a far better plan.

Take a look at the comparisons of the two projects:

Baldwin County Economic Development Alliance is aware of both projects, it will be interesting what’s their take on the two proposals. Keep in mind BCEDA has not been able to find a home for the Mega-Site.

BCEDA is funded by:

We are truly an alliance in Baldwin County, being funded and supported by our county government, 14 municipalities, 5 Chambers of Commerce, 8 Industrial Development Boards, and over 100 privately owned businesses. We have 17 voting members on our board of directors, of which each of our 5 Chambers of Commerce appoints three members in staggering terms. Additionally, our board consists of two ex-officio members, which are a rotating Mayor and County Commissioner each year.

Let’s see if the City Council and BCEDA are truthful with the citizens that financially support them and elect them to office.

Ask Yourself why has the City Council not allowed public participation related to the TWO projects?

Beware of the pop up target.
