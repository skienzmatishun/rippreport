 I think that Fairhope will soon be like Detroit Michigan. Everyone will be tired of the corruption and lost quality of life and will just up and leave their dwindling property values. No way it continues to go up. Too many negatives now. Corruption in a city government like this is a huge tell to people wanting to retire. Those that are smart that is.
