 The same people that think Jack Burrell hung the moon are the idiots who voted for him or didn’t vote at all and let him win. It’s no different than this Liberal bullshit that Biden and his gang are out there praising the latest covid stimulus plan signed into law and how they are all giddy and jumping up and down with all this stupid Democrats and liberals  celebrating a bill that only has a small percentage going towards covid itself. You don’t have to be a rocket scientist to know that just with gas prices surging the $1400 dollar stimulus check that is on the way has already been spent. With gas prices skyrocketing, which means for you people that don’t know anything about economics, this means it’s more to fill up your vehicles, more for groceries, more foe things made from petroleum, etc. etc etc!  People are just plain blind or so under educated that they let these people do what they want to. It’s a shame that Biden is doing this to us but it’s a damn shame to let a local FART in OUR own city of Fairhope, do it to us who have worked so very hard to try and have a nice place for our families to live. What a disgrace and terrible example that Burrell and his dogs are setting for the younger generation!
