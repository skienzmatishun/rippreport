The Baldwin County Sheriff Office has a culture that is ABSOLUTE IMMUNITY. No accountability or transparency. BCSO investigates itself by using their own investigative force, Baldwin County Major Crimes Division. This culture is not in the best interest or safety of citizens of Baldwin County.

Absolute Immunity guarantees corruption. Ask yourself who else or what other agency has absolute immunity? This culture was developed by former sheriff Hoss Mack and passed on to our current appointed sheriff Anthony Lowery.

The record of the BCSO for the past 18 years is clouded with numerous cases of loss of life by a sheriff officer or police officer “JUSTIFIED” by their Major Crimes Division. Unsolved cases, wrongful convictions and citizen complaints that are ignored.

{{< socialpreview url="https://rippreport.com/p/justice-denied-a-wrongful-conviction-buried-by-power-and-politics-repost/" >}}

Anthony Lowery was the lead investigator for the District Attorney who convicted and innocent man, Murray Lawrence Jr.

This culture has infected our judicial system who ignores its citizens while exacerbating a bad situation to much worse. Judges selected and elected have become blind to constituents safety and remain loyal to the good ole boy system that secures their jobs.

This culture has existed way to long we desperately need a change and an end to the sheriff department investigating themselves. This should be the job of ALEA, Alabama Law Enforcement Agency.

Baldwin County has an organized good ole boy group known formerly as Catalyst now Scott Boone Consulting. They support ONLY those loyal to members of their group. Sounds like a conspiracy theory but you can bet your ass it is for real. This is the culture Baldwin County is subject to and its got to change.

First step to eliminate a failed Sheriff Department is to be sure Anthony Lowery is NOT elected. Many good sheriff department deputies and officers want a change.

Get involved and VOTE. This is the most important political race in Baldwin County and the good ole boys will do anything to hold on to power. It is up to YOU.

Please support Matt McKenzie and attend his campaign kickoff reception Jan. 15 at Oak Hollow Farm
