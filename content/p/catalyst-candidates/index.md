Qualifications for Mid Term elections are over and now it is a race to the primary June 9 2018.

{{< socialpreview url="https://rippreport.com/p/qualification/" >}}

The official list of 2018 Local and State Candidates was provided by the Elections Coordinator for the Baldwin County Probate Office. The only alteration to this list is the reference to Catalyst Candidates and the office of Court of Civil Appeals, Michelle Thomason, The Catalyst Queen, that was added by the Ripp Report.

As you can see Catalyst has candidates seeded in many offices, it would be a monumental mistake to allow Catalyst control of our county government. Please advise your friends and fellow citizens about this Good Ole Boys plan.
