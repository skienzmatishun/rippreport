 Thanks for the post.  It is very unfortunate that the City of Gulf Shores is so 
much a part of the problems of over production of subdivisions. They are now everywhere, all with small lots, inexpensive houses, and we all have to use the same roadways that have not been changed in years, and I only here talk, talk, talk, of more and wider North/South road projects. Nothing will be built in the near future. We need less housing and more roads.
