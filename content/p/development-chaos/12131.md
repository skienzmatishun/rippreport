 I've been talking about this since moving back to Baldwin County.  I live in Foley in a no zone subdivision with only a limp HOA to carry out laws.  Baldwin County would only care if I was making meth or growing pot.  They could care less about helping the residents.  They only care about tourist and money.  They claim to be a city moving forward.  City's moving forward do not place all grocery stores and shopping in one hub.  After six years, I will have a Mexican Supermarket behind my backyard.  Do you think the County cares about their retired residents...NO!  We have no rights.  During a critical buyers market, it's likely I'll be unable to relocate.  The expense to avoid rodents, roaches, and other predator's will be costly for us retiree's and still our sleep will be often interrupted by late night truck deliveries and very early morning dumpster pick up.  Hwy 98 is also very loud because Baldwin County has no noise ordinance for loud muffler's. Sirens are heard often and no one care's about speed limits, so safety and health is out of the question. Who will be next to enter the door of the cancer center? Maybe those who are so careless and have no consideration about the health of others but only want to fill their pockets because of greed.  May God have mercy on you all!!
