 The Baldwin Count Economic Development Alliance is so full of bull.  It is full of retired guys who have nothing to do but try to rub shoulders with politicians and name drop.   They LOVE to talk and talk and talk.   They love to waste other peoplesâ€™ time because time is all they have.
Baldwin County is growing on its own and much too fast.  Yet this group will claim credit every time a gas station gets built.
