 No we donot need more people.   This place has gotten so crowded.  You cannot get around without traffic jams.   Shoot, the highway dept just put up ANOTHER stop light just south of the one at the Rock Creek entrance
That is their answer:  more stop lights, more taxes, and more subdivisions.  These politicians need to get voted OUT of office and end the tyranny of these outside developers 
I thought this is why we elected Karin.   Why is this overbuilding still going on?
