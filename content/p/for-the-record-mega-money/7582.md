 Baldwin County is a money pot for the rest of the state.  Need money? Go to Madison, Shelby, and Baldwin.  These counties are full of suburbanites not caring about the area.  
To the transient residents, Baldwin is just a stop on their careers.  Buy a house, mortgage it, raise kids, get transferred, sell the house and move on to the next area.  In the meantime, play ball at the parks, take the kids to Chuckee Cheese, and build up your 401(k).  And they want MORE of these type of people here.
Have more traffic? Four lane the roads.   Need more sewers?  Tax the residents and not the developers.  Need a local politician to approve out of control growth?  Call Catalyst and they will buy on for you.
This is what these local politicians have brought us.  Elections do indeed have consequences.
