 There sure are a lot of maybes and what ifs you have going there.

Some great lines here:
"Now, you fight corrupt elections in Fairhope but cheer a corrupt election nationwide because you are such an anarchist it has blinded you. Your brain is not functioning correctly, I am afraid."


??  Do you know what the word anarchist means?

"He then moved control of the election process to the Department of Homeland Security. Trump was playing 3D chess while you and the demoncrats were and still are playing chinese checkers."
3D chess. So, uh, chess. The election process is in the hands of the states.  He can't just decide to federalize it.  Where are you getting this stuff?
