 THE COURT: Before you begin, let me just start off with my questions. So there are subsets. There are 592 ballots which have been identified and segregated. You’ve identified, of that, 509 that have the voter’s address preprinted on the outer envelope, to the right of the voter’s declaration. There is a subset: 266 of those people put their addresses on the front of the envelope, not on the back, where probably it was indicated. Does that mean that for the other 243 of the 509 there’s no written address by the elector, there is just the printed address that the County put on the envelope?

    MR. McGARRY: Your Honor, for that number that you just said, the answer to your question is that in addition to having the printed address, there also is the bar code, Your Honor. And the bar code scans to the SURE system with a specific identification of the voter involved, which would include their address. But in terms of handwriting the address on the outer envelope, you are correct.
