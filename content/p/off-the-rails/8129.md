 I repeat, I wash my hands AFTER the poop is off.  You only make that mistake once.  1. It might be poop.  This makes sure it's a fish.  Take a deep breath into your hands.  Does it smell like shit?  Keep washing until they smell like fish.
2. While it tastes a little better, you WILL get sick.  It's worth the 15 seconds.  Wash the damn fish.  I learned this the hard way.
