 I'm getting very tired of yall attacking the fishing industry.  It's never been better.  When we spot that beautiful Fairhope famous brown mass of incoming water and turd that shine like gold. Fairhope Brown Gold we call it. You don't even need nets, the fish just pop up to the surface.  They are a little browner than usual, but the CDC says I'm good if I wash it which is great I can eat for weeks.  Before you start bashing me for that, I wash my hands after wiping the poop off.  Why do you want to take food off my family and all the restaurants tables.  I thought you were pro business here.
