Sheriff Huey Mack has a breakthrough case.. in spite of his vaccinations and refusal to enforce the duly issued Stay At Home order last Spring Break. His Deputies removed several people from the Baldwin County School Board meeting where Eddie Tyler announced that all staff, teachers, visitors, and students 2nd grade and up must wear masks.

There is a new bridge battle afoot. The Mayor of the two fiefdoms, Gulf Shores and Orange Beach are at odds, big surprise, but the Baldwin Bridge Company's contractual gun to our heads ensures that our hands are tied unless we play ball with them.
