35.4 Million SARS-COV-2 infected in the USA with 615,000 deaths. The Delta variant has Gulf Coastal Hospitals filling fast and your elected officials are finally getting the picture.

Sheriff Huey Mack has a breakthrough case.. in spite of his vaccinations and refusal to enforce the duly issued Stay At Home order last Spring Break. His Deputies removed several people from the Baldwin County School Board meeting where Eddie Tyler announced that all staff, teachers, visitors, and students 2nd grade and up must wear masks.

There is a new bridge battle afoot. The Mayor of the two fiefdoms, Gulf Shores and Orange Beach are at odds, big surprise, but the Baldwin Bridge Company's contractual gun to our heads ensures that our hands are tied unless we play ball with them.

Steve Russo-Frank Burt-Tim James , you get the picture. The Taxman Elliott's Police Jurisdiction Law will not only increase the size of the Sheriff's territory but it prevents the City of Fairhope from enforcing it's wetlands protection ordinance, who benefits?

The Lagniappe skewers the UA Board again over ghost employees and golden parachutes.

And we get a nebulous response to the Writ of Mandamus filed against the Alabama Ethics Commission in Montgomery County Circuit Court (Our Writ and their 12(b) response will be posted later today). And10 term Limestone County Sheriff Mike Blakley was convicted of corruption this week, as an aside.
