 If you don’t have a strong stance on The Zundel issue. Then shut the hell up. You want facts. Just go look at the campaign signs in front of the houses around there. These are mainly Catalyst supporters and that’s a fact. They do not agree with the public having access and have screamed and shouted at people who are doing nothing but walking down to see the water. So Shut up. That’s all the facts you need. A 5 year old can figure this one out.
