 Don't count on it - they have Jon Gray, the PR person who tells Tucker and Elliot to say "God tells us to do this."  You see, thump a Bible, say you are for Trump, and will fight against sanctuary cities and you will hypnotize the voting masses.
But people are finding out that Tucker and Elliot do not have a monopoly on God or Trump and know that one can be against sanctuary cities and Tucker/Elliot at the same time.
