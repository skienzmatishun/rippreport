 We look at campaign finance reports and see the Catalyst supporters on the bay.  Don't be glib and ask for facts - we have them and so do you.  We see where money from out of state have been feeding these candidates and buying them so they can further have their way in our Baldwin County.  Elliot and Dorsey have sold out Baldwin County and we the people are going to take it back.
By the way, I and others have been using Zundel Road for years long before those people moved in and tried to hijack our home.  Tucker and Elliot have been part of the gang that have been complicit in letting these people steal our birthright.  These two have hit a hot button this time.
Are you getting the picture now? We are tired of you and your filthy corrupt candidates stealing our home - we are coming and will not stop until our home is returned to us...
