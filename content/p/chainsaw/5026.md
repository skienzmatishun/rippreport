 I can assure you that Jack Burrell and some of his family members are creating pure evil in our schools and Jack has always thought he was King Kong. He’s  just a dumbass who we have let too much rope out. Let’s reel it in and straighten him and his family member out!!! Freakin tired of the BS going on and on and on. Everyone grow a pair and throw out all of them. Scott Boone, are you being sweet on some of the candidates. I thought you were a real man. But I’m not judging. I know some men who are jealous though. Tell us Scott Boone?  You seem to come up to everyone I have talked to lately. Don’t talk to or try and screw my candidates after you pull their pants down.
