 Burrell is frightening as the City Council President who refuses to cede his authority as directed.  He is taking Fairhope into bankruptcy for his own inflated ego.  The weak council members need to push him aside and allow Robinson to take over the Presidency of the Council for the good of the City.  Burrell is an embarrassment blowhard (a bit of a baby trumpeter having tantrums).  The other Council members seem to be decent but they are terrified of standing up to him.
