 Tucker Dorsey may be big enough to haul a kayak from across Scenic 98 all the way down Zundel to the water, but I am not.  If I drive into the Bay by accident, I promise to not sue Baldwin County or the State of Alabama.  Zundel Road needs to remain open unless and until we see dozens of Alabama idiots driving off the pier like lemmings.
