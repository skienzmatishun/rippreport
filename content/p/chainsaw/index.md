It does not take a chain saw, it only takes a vote.

Sometimes you have to send a strong public message to politicians, elected officials and appointed boards to get their attention. When people do unite and reach a level of frustration that brings them together, then you see results. Petitions are a very good way to send a strong message.

Baldwin County Commissioner Chris Elliott, supported by Tucker Dorsey, both are Catalyst candidates, recently tried, again, to deny the Zundle’s Road public access to Mobile Bay. They did not count on the chainsaw or Lagniappe.

{{< socialpreview url="https://www.lagniappemobile.com/news/local/man-chainsaws-public-barricade-dumps-debris-in-county-office/article_02a8acb6-72ff-53c4-89ee-8f7ecad8d146.html" >}}

You have to ask yourself why would an elected official running for office do such a dumb thing. There is an easy answer. Donors to their campaigns, that live on the bay, do not want to be bothered with the common folk using public access on Zundle’s Road.

Please sign the petition that supports the Zundel’s Road, public access to Mobile bay

A vote is stronger than a petition, Please unite and show Elliott, Dorsey and Catalyst the door, June 5 Primary election.
