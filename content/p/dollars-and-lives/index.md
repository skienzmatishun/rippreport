## DOLLARS

The City of Fairhope’s 6.2 million dollar waterfront project became a political hot potato during the last municipal election. Politicians put their feet in their mouths and now are trying to spin a new narrative. The new narrative will be what Mayor Sullivan and the, other Mayor, Jack Burrell want.

The Ripp Report has filed a foia, freedom of information request, for the past results of a charrette where 164 participants, and the 570 people participated. We also requested a copy of the 6.2 million dollar grant. This information originated with the Wilson administration. Please be aware that this project spanned over several years and the public comments were gleamed from multiple public events, over several months.

Since the election, the new Mayor’s announced that the city would accept written comments for two weeks only. The Ripp Report also fioa requested a copy of those comments. All information that we are able to acquire will be shared through the Ripp Report. Two weeks, does that sound like transparency?

I was given a copy of a booklet published in Fairhope around 1938, by a local bank that was sharing interesting facts about south Alabama. Fact, Fairhope was previously Alabama City and well over a hundred years ago the city built a coffer dam, bulkhead structure for a pier. Guess where the fill came from? The current road entrance to the pier. Fairhope’s early settlers took that dirt and filled and supported the pier. At the same time the park property on both sides of the road was formed from fill and cutting back on the bank.

Point being what some people are calling historic bluffs are cut back banks from previous construction. The second point is no one, except Howing Rains, has said plans called for the “bulldozing of the bluffs”, that is BS

## LIVES

Fairhope has been hammered by the general public and health care workers over how the city has handled the covid virus.

Maybe they have learned a lesson because now they have been forced to cancel the Christmas Parade.

To date, 278,000 lives lost and 14.3 million cases, in the United States. 3157 lives in one day that is 1000 less than the country of Japan during the whole pandemic. 200,000 new cases and over 100,000 in the hospital. Projected deaths by Dec.26 are estimated at 303,000 to 329,000. Alarming statistics roll in every day.

Scientists, Doctors, CDC and World Health Organization have been making predictions for months and each month they are proven right. Yet we have people that still will not even wear a mask.

When you see someone NOT wearing a mask then you know that person has no respect for others, especially our health care workers. When you see a Mayor, Councilperson or Council President Not wearing a mask then you know your city has a lack of leadership.

Your mask helps protect those around you

COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person through respiratory droplets. Respiratory droplets travel into the air when you cough, sneeze, talk, shout, or sing. These droplets can then land in the mouths or noses of people who are near you or they may breathe these droplets in.

Masks are a simple barrier to help prevent your respiratory droplets from reaching others. Studies show that masks reduce the spray of droplets when worn over the nose and mouth.

You should wear a mask, even if you do not feel sick. This is because several studies have found that people with COVID-19 who never develop symptoms (asymptomatic) and those who are not yet showing symptoms (pre-symptomatic) can still spread the virus to other people. The main function of wearing a mask is to protect those around you, in case you are infected but not showing symptoms.

It is especially important to wear a mask when you are unable to stay at least 6 feet apart from others since COVID-19 spreads mainly among people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).

## RESPECT OTHERS WEAR A MASK
