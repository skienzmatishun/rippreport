 No one in the newly elected administration has enough brain power or imagination to write a grant, much less bear the fruits of such labor. I can remember JackA?? sniffed and smug when he belittled Mayor Karin fir her enthusiasm on grant writing back in the day. 
Nothing was ever right that she did, according to that gang of thugs. 

Now they will take full credit, knowing full well plans were executed properly and with professionals by Mayor Karin. Not once were the preliminaries presented written in stone and there was openness to adjust the plans.
As you say, they slanted, put out misinformation and created a political hot potato! 
Again, their behavior is shameful. 
I am so glad Mayor Karin doesnâ€™t have to be subjected to their cruelty any longer.
