Fly Creek residents are now seeing more mud coming into the creek due to infrastructure failures. The Publix project started the damage by dumping tons of mud into the creek. Then came the fly creek apartments that no one wanted except Mayor Kant, Jack Burrell and the City Council. Now all the predictions are coming true AGAIN.

Highway 98 shoulder on the south side over fly creek has caved in, dumping tons of dirt into the creek.

To repair the damage tons of red dirt has been dumped on the site overhanging Fly Creek.

It is a very steep slope that cannot be compacted. The foundation of the culvert has been damaged in several areas. The current work is a band aid and will soon need repair again when the freshly deposited red soil ends up in the creek.

As many as 4 or 5 lawsuits have followed the Publix project and the apartments. The developer, Angelo Corte has sold the apartments after his sales pitch to Fairhope citizens that the apartments would be a top rate project that they have no intention of selling. The apartments have already experienced flooding damaging several units. Corte, as predicted sold the apartments got his money and then moved on, now the citizens will pay for repair after repair, lawsuit after lawsuit.

This is Karma. The infrastructure in Fairhope has had failures all over town. Electric and freshwater issues and constant flooding of the sewer system. Who is responsible? The current Mayor worked for Mayor Kant and continuously wrote articles in the cityâ€™s propaganda newsletter disavowing any city responsibility. The current City Council with exception of Corry Martin is the same council who supported, Mayor Tim Canâ€™t, and still remain in office. DO NOT SWIM IN THE BAY.

The damage done through the years has cost millions and will continue to cost millions to consistently repair the damage from the outfall of water from Publix and the apartments. Upstream the banks of Fly Creek are eroding and fallen trees crisscross the creek.

This is what the developer does not want you to see. The Kant-Corte Apartments are the responsibility of the last council, Mr Burrell and Mr Boone played a very important part in the success of the apartments.

Fauxhope you elected these individuals that are pro development, pro toll and ignored infrastructure for 16 years.

Citizens made a horrible decision in the last election Mayor Wilson was addressing the issues that the current council has ignored. The corruption within the City government was curtailed and infrastructure issues addressed. Mayor Wilson obtained in excess of 10 million in infrastructure grants.

Mayor Sullivan and the current council will most likely NOT complete the grants afforded the city, before their term ends. Please pay attention and donâ€™t vote for the same damn people again. Vote them OUT. Take a good look at the pictures taken today.
