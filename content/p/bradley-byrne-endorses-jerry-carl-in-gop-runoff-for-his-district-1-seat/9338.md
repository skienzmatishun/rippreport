 Trent, it’s not so much that he might be a commie, but it is for certain that he is a Catalyst.
That is why I will not vote for anyone associated with this outfit
If Sheriff Mack uses Catalyst again then he  will not get my vote. I liked Kant but Kant used Catalyst in 2016.   I was so disappointed in him.    I have now seen what this group does and it is control their “clients.”
