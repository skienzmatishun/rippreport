 We all need to keep being vigilant on Catalyst and its sneaky moves.   Just watching this group’s movement in Bay Minette, Daphne, Spanish Fort, and Fairhope let’s me know they are getting on the defense
Catalyst, whether it be called Elliot, Haygood, and Stacy, or you call it the “Machine” or you call it after the late Lyn Stacey, it is still a bunch of politicians that were bought by real estate developers so these developers can do what they please in the county.  These same politicians stick together and hold parties for themselves and do not care about the people they were elected to serve.   Of course you will see them in the larger churches in the area so they can put their phony Christianity on display.  This plays well to the voters and Catalysts know this
You politicians who are owned by Catalyst better be prepared to explain why you continue to be owned by Catalyst
