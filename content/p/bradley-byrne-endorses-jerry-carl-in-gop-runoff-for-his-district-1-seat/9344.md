 Lowtower is a Catalyst.  He really does NOT care about the people he claims wishes to "represent."  He just wants to get in with Catalyst and make money off of over developing, grab his money and leave.  This is how developers work.  They are like locusts coming in, pillaging the area, and moving off to another area. 
They are the modern equivalent of marauding invaders.
