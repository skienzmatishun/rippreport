Catalyst is fully supporting Tucker Dorsey for Baldwin County commission and also is hoping Chris Elliott fills the State Senate Race. These Catalyst dogs need to be kicked to the curb, they need to go.

If we want our commissioners to listen to the people of Baldwin County and expect the State Senator to represent us, then we must get rid of the dogs.

A vote for Tucker Dorsey is a vote for Clarence Burke and Baldwin County Sewer and the many LLC’s Tucker is affiliated with.

Pay attention to that Summerdale address and you will see a Catalyst connection to many a good ole boy.

Summerdale 13040 Underwood Rd. has more LLC’s than fleas on a dog.

Tucker Dorsey uses the LLC’s to hide his many business interests and you can bet Chris Elliott is covering for him.

Guess what the address is ?

Chris Elliott is not State Senate material. He wants our vote, for what? The Mega “Dump” site that cost taxpayers 32 plus MILLION?

Does this sound like a State Senator?

If I have not convinced you yet that these two political, self serving, Catalyst loving dogs need to go, then read this article about the both of them. Two Commissioners who depend on donations for their re-election. That is the backstory for this article. A couple of people that live on the Bay do not want the public to have access to the Bay. So just give a little money to the right commissioners and they will bar the Public from the Bay. Elliott and Dorsey did not count on the Chainsaw.

You do not need a chain saw! You need to vote out these Catalyst dogs. June 5 2018
