 Congratulations on the nomination for the blog award Mr. Ripp.
I am friends with Jack Burrell and am encouraging him to run for Congress.
I think he has done much for the city and it is time for him to run for
a higher office. I don't always agree with your stance but I do
think you have a write to say what you do.
