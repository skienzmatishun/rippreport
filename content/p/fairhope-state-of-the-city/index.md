Mayor Karin Wilson of Fairhope, AlabamaHope to See You Thursday for Our State of the City Expo This Thursday, 5pm, Fairhope Civic Center.

Fairhope this your chance to meet employees and see the different departments of the city. It takes around 300 employees from office staff to public works to keep the city maintained and running in top financial shape.

The Catalyst City Council will be present and I could think of a million questions but lets settle for one. First some info:

{{< socialpreview url="https://www.lagniappemobile.com/news/fairhope-evaluates-properties-for-expansion-of-sports-facilities/article_a84a626f-5b78-53dc-93aa-b320ed2c1497.html" >}}

The piece of land the council rejected was first choice of the State Park Board, the citizens of the community, city staff and the Mayor.

The council ordered the appraisal before citizens knew, and it is dated June 28, 2019.

This so called appraisal was highly questionable, and the brain child of councilmen Burrell, Brown and Boone.

They had made up their minds in June but strung the citizens out for months explaining, “we are only getting an appraisal”.

The 3B’s then move to close on the property without any public input on the proposed property.

In December they paid the 2.65 million for the farmland.

Your tax dollars.

This money was not allocated or budgeted for recreation land.

Keep in mind they purchased the K1 center and Nix building, for over 5 million, which needs roof repairs.

The main city hall needs a new roof and recreation upgrades within the city are needed.

Millions of dollars are now not available for city infrastructure projects and these projects are now being held up for lack of budgeted funds.

In January 2020 the City Council declared the same 2.65 million dollar property:

> 6\. Ordinance – An Ordinance to declare that certain real property (105 Farmable Acres) of the City of Fairhope is temporarily designated surplus and not needed for public or municipal purposes in response to an offer to lease property yearly from January 1 through December 31 for one year with four one-year options.

Within 60 days of purchase the property is designated “surplus and not needed for public or municipal purposes.” It is leased for $9000.00 a year.

This is no joke.

They have no money to develop the property???

THE QUESTION IS, WHO GOT THE “COMMISSION CHECK” BURRELL, BROWN OR BOONE ????

## ? OR ALL THREE? ?

## THIS DEAL STINKS!

This is a CATALYST COUNCIL and they will set their sites on the triangle property next.

This council represents CATALYST not Fairhope,. In 2020 the citizens of Fairhope should vote their sorry asses out of office.

If you don’t Fairhope will be known as ? CATALYST ? and the flowers will wilt.
