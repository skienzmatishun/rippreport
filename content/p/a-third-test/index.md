The past is catching up with Sheriff Mack and his self investigating team, Major Crimes Unit. This is the second federal lawsuit and more one is pending. The Ripp Report has been covering the O J French case since he was murdered by Bay Minette police officer Brandon Thompson.


Mack is hauling ass out of Baldwin County and he wants Anthony Lowery to replace him. I wonder if Mr. Lowery has given any thought as to what problems, lawsuits and investigations that are surfacing that Mack is trying to dump in Lowery’s lap. Sounds like Sheriff Mack is doing Lowery no favor.


These type lawsuits can often result in millions of dollars in damages.


Mayor Wills of Bay Minette the City Council and Police Chief Al Tolbert all tried to sweep the murder under the rug. Their behavior towards the community and family was despicable.


Bay Minette should Vote out the Mayor and fire the police chief.


This was last night in Bay Minette:

The County Commission was warned that they were facing possible Federal Lawsuits. The Commission did nothing

The Ripp Report wrote several articles about the Bay Minette Police, County Commission and Sheriff. They dismissed complaints, withheld evidence and ignored inquires involving Mr. French’s murder. Now they face the music.

BCMCU consists of Bay Minette Police Chief Al Tolbert, who is the current chairman, Robertsdale Police Chief Brad Kendrick, Sheriff Huey “Hoss” Mack of the Baldwin County Sheriff’s Office (BCSO), Gulf Shores Police Chief Edward Delmore, Daphne Police Chief David Carpenter and Foley Police Chief Thurston Bullock. The agency is tasked with reviewing the actions of officers working for its member organizations.

BCMCU has no credibility. They are investigating themselves and Chief Tolbert of Bay Minette is the Chairman? It is prosperous to believe BCMCU could conduct an unbiased investigation of their own members.

Mr French is the 10th loss of life in Baldwin County where the BCMCU has investigated themselves. The first 8 found no police at fault and camera footage was withheld from the public.
