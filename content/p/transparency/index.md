The Fairhope City Council has not approved a single Fairhope City Budget, on time, in the last 3 years. Their only accomplishment, so far, has been to pass an ordinance for sleeping in cars, a perfect example of a lack of compassion and leadership.

Please read the Mayor’s report and take special note on how the City Council address the issues within the report. The Council is comprised of representatives of the status quo, good ole boy politicians. They are not transparent, accountable or ethical. Ask Yourself where is the Council Report?

The Mayor of Fairhope is a PUBLIC SERVANT, Totally transparent. She and her staff should be commended for their hard work and dedication to the citizens of Fairhope. The Clown Car Passengers need to go in 2020.

FIRST EVER SELF-SUSTAINING BUDGET!

SEPTEMBER 2, 2019 COMMUNITY

For the first time in Fairhope history, the 2020 City Budget proposal requires zero dollars of utility profits to balance. The City is finally self-sustaining financially and can run independently from our Utility Department. There are ZERO dollars paying for government operating expenses. I’m not sure how many ways I can articulate it, but this is a very good thing and something to be celebrated!

{{< socialpreview url="https://web.archive.org/web/20200815203446/http://www.mayorkarinwilson.com/first-ever-self-sustaining-budget/" >}}

“And in case anyone tries to tell you “it’s all City money”, know that is not true. The City operates with tax dollars. The Utility Department operates with rate fees. The money is not the same and going back to the old way of doing business should never happen again. “

“We have much more to cover during September and I have implored Council to take the time needed to meet and ensure the budget passes on time this year. All amendments to the proposed budget must take place with communication in open meetings for the benefit of citizens, employees and me. This is how all government budgets are developed. Council has avoided this open process the last three budget cycle and it is contrary to State Statute.”

This process before has enabled Council to sit on the budget for many months beyond the deadline without any accountability and prevented the ability of employees and I to do our job successfully. Please help us hold them accountable. With Council’s willingness to pass the budget by the 10/1 deadline, we can make 2020 a model year for our citizens.

Sincerely,

Mayor Karin Wilson
