 Everyone always tries to be the Christian Politician and brag about how many times  they go to Church or a prayer breakfast or just can’t tell you enough times “what a huge Christian they are”!  Well according to the King James Version of the Bible, Psalms 118 verse 8, it reads “It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man”. Watching all these men brag on their Christian values and how great they are really makes the quote from Psalms pretty neat and very and I mean very TRUE!
You all want us to respect you as a Christian? Show us instead of shoving it in our faces everyday!
True That!  If all these people would act like Christians instead of trying to convince people that they are one, wow! wouldn’t that be a breath of fresh air.
