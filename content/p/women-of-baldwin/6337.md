 You talk about Danielle Madhburn Myrick not having any experience in Montgomery - well when Joe Faust started did he have any experience?? NO - his resume he just picked &amp; choose what he wanted to put in it.  He was not an Insurance Broker - he was a Insurance salesman.  Also he did not even list all the other many jobs he has had over the years.  Why??  Who is he trying to fool?  The legislation job is the only job he has been able to keep - just shaking hands &amp; being in politics.
