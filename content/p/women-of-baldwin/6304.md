 Ripp, you and everyone else should question the true “Party” of Andrea Lindsey. Facts are she campaigned for Obama, Bernie Sanders and Hillary. Now she is running as a Republican in order to have a better chance at winning this BOE position.  And the real sad part is the Republican Executive Committee of Baldwin County are aware of this, but want to “check the box” off that  Republican won.
