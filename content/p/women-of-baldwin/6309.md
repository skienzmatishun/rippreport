 So women of Baldwin County should listen to an old white guy on how not to vote for old white men?

How about not telling us women what to do. We can and will think for ourselves.

Many of the women running for office in Baldwin County are great choices to vote for, but Danielle Mashburn-Myrick is not one of them. She is educated and a nice person, but did you know she has never sat through a legislative session. She has no idea how the House of Representatives work.
She talks about better education and health care, but some of the changes she says she is going to fight for, are not at a state level. That means she can't change them, or fight for them because it is at a federal level. 
This woman doesn't want someone who decides to run for office on a whim and hasn't even done their homework.  Don't know what it takes to get a bill passed, has never been to Montgomery even to checkout what is involved in the job!
Joe Faust may be old school, but he is a good man. And has done great things for our county and state. You can't find any dirt on him so you try and dirty his reputation by saying he must be because some of his fellow representatives are. Shame on you Ripp. You say you're a reporter, so report the truth. 
This woman will not be voting a straight ticket but I will not vote for a women just because she is a woman.
