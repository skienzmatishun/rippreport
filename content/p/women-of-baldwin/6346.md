 I have been reading the back and forth remarks about the elderly gentleman, Representative Faust and his quest to be re-elected. 
I read several of the AL.com articles &amp; have decided that I still have some unanswered questions about Faust and maybe some of your readers can help.
I read one article that had an attached summary of facts leading up to Representative Davis’ indictment. It sounded as though Faust was aware that Representative Davis was trying to force Blue Cross and Blue Shield to pay for services for a diabetic clinic that Davis had ownership in. Faust even participated in the treatments so that he could testify before a committee of his fellow representatives in order help Davis and his diabetic treatment clinics by forcing Blue Cross to pay for the treatments at the clinics. 
It seems to me that Mr. Faust should have used better judgement. Even I don’t think Blue Cross should be forced to pay for treatments that they have not approved. If they had been forced to pay for treatments in Mr. Davis’s clinics, does anyone, including Mr. Faust understand that those costs would trickle down to the consumers? If not, he should have. 
I think too little is being made of Mr. Faust’s judgement and participation in this scheme. 
Personally, I don’t think I could pull the lever for such a person.
Thank you.
