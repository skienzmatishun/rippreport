 Before anything is proven or not regarding the allegations concerning Roy Moore. Some of you need to be VERY cautious before casting a stone. There are many of you who are guilty of such possible deeds and you damn sure are not sin free. Republican senators, congressmen and representatives have all been guilty of sexual harassment. Even the great God all mighty Richard Shelby would be considered a frequent sexual harasser himself to a lot of people up north for just being a southern gentleman and saying sweetheart or my dear or even placing a hand on the back of a shoulder some of these assholes would scream rape. Get it together all you chicken shit women and come out now and let's get this over and done with. Hell, I'm a man and I got sexually harassed years ago by a female boss. My fault for not bringing it up then. But I'll be damn if I'm gonna get up on the roof top and blame and point fingers to the whole world with shame that happened 5, 10, 15, 20 or even more years ago. Bitches, it's 2017. Now is the time to say it out loud or shut the F up!!!!   Even if you enjoyed it and got ahead or benefited from it. Speak out now. It's 2017!!!!!!  Some of you Senators might ought to barley breath.  You know who you are. 
Innocent until proven guilty or if it's true?  Guilty just like some of the rest of you!!!
