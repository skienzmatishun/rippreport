The most favorite words of a politician or elected official in Baldwin County are Transparency and Accountability, The most lacking quality of life issue, in Baldwin County, is Transparency and Accountability.

Listed below are articles exposing land fraud, Judicial voter disenfranchisement, Ethics violations, by no less than the Executive Director of Ethics, Baldwin County Sheriff Office Lawsuits and nine innocent lives lost. Then there is the scared cow of Alabama, the U of A and a culture of silence.

Alabama is number one when it comes to Corruption and the success of staying number one is silence. No one accepts any responsibility and their is a total lack of oversight, throughout the state. It does make you wonder if the Feds in Alabama are also asleep.

STRAWMAN LAND FRAUD

https://lagniappemobile.com/serial/straw-man-lawsuit-reveals-complex-baldwin-business-partnerships/

What makes this case of particular interest is not only Bass’ claims that Burke, the president of Baldwin County Sewer Service and a well-known developer in Baldwin County, and Delaney, a prominent South Alabama lender, conspired to use a Ponzi scheme to defraud Bass, but also that those sealed records reveal many of the business and political connections between some of the major players in Baldwin County development over the past two decades, according to charts entered as exhibits in the case that provide a guide through the labyrinth of intermingled companies involved in the case.

Many people watched the bully council in their last meeting where Councilman Boone flipped out at the end of the meeting. What many people did not know was why? Watch the video again and you will see that when I mention the “Strawman” series in Lagniappe, Boone realized that I had read some of the latest information submitted to the Alabama Judiciary related to the case.

ELECTED DISTRICT JUDGE ACTING IN CAPACITY OF UN-ELECTED CIRCUIT JUDGE:

https://lagniappemobile.com/lawsuit-contests-perpetual-appointment-to-baldwin-county-court/

In the motion, Burdick claimed state law limits the duration of special court appointments to 180 consecutive days and “the successive reappointment's of Thomason to hear circuit court cases for more than a decade is a blatant act of voter disenfranchisement.”

https://rippreport.com/%f0%9f%94%97/

The good, honest and ethical members of our legal community, and politicians, are absent and silent. They are to scared to challenge the corruption of the good ole boys, aka The Machine, adopting a “just go along attitude”.

Judge Thomason is the worst of the worst when it comes to corrupt Judges in Baldwin Count.

ABSOLUTELY NO ETHICS

https://rippreport.com/license-to-steal/

“As director of the Alabama Ethics Commission, Tom Albritton is the state’s policeman for conflicts of interest and ethical breaches that can arise throughout all levels of government, but having a private charitable trust he helps oversee pay more than $100,000 for his kids’ college tuition”

https://lagniappemobile.com/mabel-amos-memorial-fund-more-scholarship-money-for-ethics-chiefs-kids/

“(1) In general for purposes of this section, the term “self-dealing” means any direct or indirect — (A) sale or exchange, or leasing, of property between a private foundation and a disqualified person; (B) lending of money or other extension of credit between a private foundation and a disqualified person; (C) furnishing of goods, services or facilities between a private foundation and a disqualified person; (D) payment of compensation (or payment or reimbursement of expenses) by a private foundation to a disqualified person; (E) transfer to, or use by or for the benefit of, a disqualified person of the income or assets of a private foundation; and (F) agreement by a private foundation to make any payment of money or other property to a government official (as defined in section 4946(c)), other than an agreement to employ such individual for any period after the termination of his government service if such individual is terminating his government service within a 90-day period.”

This is exactly what the Executive Director of Alabama Ethics Commission, Tom Albritton is guilty of: “Self-Dealing”.

https://rippreport.com/striking-oil/

Tom Albritton and Regions Bank struck oil in Conecuh County. The population of the county is around 12,000. I guess Tom and the Bank saw no need to tell the citizens of the county or the relatives of Mabel Amos.

Conecuh County citizens were keep in the dark about the discovery of oil in their county. How could the county commissioners not know?

BALDWIN COUNTY SHERIFFS OFFICE HIDING THE TRUTH

It was Sheriff “Boss” Mack who said body cameras were for the public and the police. Mack said he needed close to700 thousand dollars for body cameras and car cameras., that these cameras would increase transparency and accountability. Now he says no to public being able to see any footage he wishes to keep secret. What’s he hiding? We will soon find out in Federal Court.

https://rippreport.com/%f0%9f%92%b8/

“Ponder the scope of today’s decision: The statute will now hide from the public eye ‘any materials related to a particular investigation;’ all ‘items of substantive evidence that existed before the investigation began, such as video recordings or documentary evidence relevant to the crime.’” Chief Justice Tom Parker.

[https://www.al.com/news/2021/09/archibald-alabama-supreme-court-dares-to-trample-your-rights.html](https://www.al.com/news/2021/09/archibald-alabama-supreme-court-dares-to-trample-your-rights.html)

“Democracy cannot operate in the dark. It’s not a sustainable institution when citizens are asked to simply trust and obey those with the most power and the most firepower. It is not sustainable when the adjudicators of the law bring their own politics through the back door to stuff them into your lives.”

U of A SACRED COW

U of A has the same philosophy as Baldwin County, just be quite, say nothing and nothing will change.

[https://www.insidehighered.com/news/alabama-system-has-employees-sign-confidentiality-agreement](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2021/10/08/alabama-system-has-employees-sign-confidentiality-agreement)

“Without limitation, ‘confidential information’ includes information or data concerning: operations; trade secrets; audit matters; compliance matters; ongoing, threatened or potential litigation; intercollegiate athletics; internal or external communications; financial plans, budgets, reports or operations; employee matters; contracts, grants and other agreements; negotiations; intellectual property (patents, trademarks, copyrights, etc.); research; academic matters; notes, plans and any other information that is generally not available to the public or to people outside”

https://lagniappemobile.com/shhhhhh-ua-system-office-demands-confidentiality-agreement-from-employees/

The agreement forces System Office employees to acknowledge that if they violate the agreement, they could “be subject to discipline up to and including termination of my employment, and other available legal or equitable remedies.

All of the above involve corruption and have been written about in the public forum, and yet nothing changes. Corruption drags down your quality of life and without transparency and accountability, corruption flourishes, under a BLACK CLOUD.
