 I see problems not being dealt with all over Baldwin County. The county is too damn big to control. Plus Hoss is running a terror organization. The judges are corrupt and the lawyers say nothing and just bill hours within the hope-less system. Most people in Alabama don't realize that they are living in a place that is more like a third world country than America. When everybody in law enforcement is on the take and they rig the cases for friends or who has the most money it is no  logger a democracy. I put my house  for sale last week. Been here 17 years from Iowa. I think the founder of fairhope was an Iowa man. He had a fair hope for  success for this place and it has been squandered by greed.
