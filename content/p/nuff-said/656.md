 I do not doubt that something is up at the airport but your evidence and argument is extremely weak. While it may be true that drugs have passed through the airport, as with any airport, you can't just decide it's happening without any proof. Besides, it is well known that this region does not have the black tar heroin problem much of the country is facing. In this region, addicts have plenty of access to pain medicine, so black tar heroin has not blown up here. Accusations like this do not help whatsoever, regardless of how you feel of these individuals. Rumor mills hurt us all. Show us documents. Show us proof. Show us you are doing more than slandering someone, because that is all you are currently doing regardless of what's going on.
