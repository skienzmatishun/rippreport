Alabama Attorney General 501 Washington ave. Montgomery Alabama 36104

Alabama Attorney General Attention Mr Steve Marshall

Dear Sir:

During the last election cycle I had the pleasure of talking with you in Fairhope Alabama, during one of your campaign stops. I explained to you the level of corruption in Baldwin County and how the Alabama Ethics Commission was not investigating ethics complaints.

You assure me, if elected, your office would take all complaints seriously. This has not been the case. In fact your office did not even respond to a complaint, or investigate the complaint, that I personally delivered to your investigators in Montgomery. The case involved a Fairhope councilman, using his board position to personally enrich himself. In this particular case the Ethics Commission believed the Councilman without any independent investigation.

The Ripp Report, founded in 2008, is a consumer organization that handles consumer issues and political corruption. Alabama is number one in the nation when it comes to political corruption, because no one is ever held accountable. The Ethics Commission, Alabama Bar and Judiciary rarely, if ever, follow through on a complaint that results in any accountability.

In fact these oversight bodies act as an insulator for corruption and their lack of action only encourages further corruption.

Enclose you will find a copy of the Lagniappe article, SELF-DEALING, an Ethics Complaint, Alabama Bar Complaint and a Writ of Mandamus. These are all related to the actions of the Director of Alabama Ethics, Tom Albritton. May I suggest that you read the Lagniappe article first.

{{< socialpreview url="https://www.lagniappemobile.com/news/local/self-dealing-ethics-director-s-kids-tuition-paid-from-trust-he-oversees/article_21349d0e-7f2e-5a35-924d-9d3d9250cfa2.html" >}}

The Lagniappe article and the Ripp Report have as many as 80,000 readers. I make note of this because we have found that the Court of Public Opinion is far more effective than those tasked with upholding the law. I assure you we will keep our readers informed on the complaints and actions filed.

{{< socialpreview url="https://rippreport.com/2021/07/15/writ-of-mandamus-and-bar-complaint/" >}}

The specific complaint against Mr Albritton is spelled out clearly, and I trust your review of the enclosed documents will expose Mr Albritton’s Self Dealing, IRS code violations and his actions as an Alabama Attorney.

{{< socialpreview url="https://rippreport.com/p/self-dealing-self-stealing/" >}}

Mr Albritton and the Ethics Commission have dismissed several complaints, listed in the Ethics Complaint and Writ of Mandamus, which include the Fairhope Councilman, they all involved situations where board members or trust attorneys have used their positions the same as Mr. Albritton.

How could the Ethics Commission find anyone guilty of self dealing, if the Director of the Ethics Commission was self dealing himself?

You Sir are the top law enforcement officer in the State of Alabama and Mr Albritton is Director of Ethics. If the citizens of Alabama are to have any confidence in our state government or its oversight capability, then certainly this is the litmus test.

Mr. Albrittion is one of three trustees, and an attorney, of the Mabel Amos Memorial Fund. This is the same fund that awarded Mr Albritton’s daughters, 105,000 dollars in scholarships, to the university of Texas.

The Mabel Amos Memorial Fund and the three trustees should be the subjects of an extensive review by the appropriate authorities. If the fund is benefiting Mr. Albritton, then it would not be a surprise that the other two trustees have also benefited.

I anxiously await your response,

Thank You Sir!

The Ripp Report

Francis Paul Ripp
