 Let's talk about the Soccer Fields.  Did any of the lawyers from Hand Arendall own this property and Mike Ford  was the Real Estate Company  that handled the sale to the city?  If the Scoccer  Association has a tournament does the city get any of the funds OR does  all of it go to the Soccer Association?  How can we find out how much money has been spent so far on the Soccer Fields?  Someone out there has the answers!!  Anyone that has a child or grandchild that plays soccer thinks having all these Fields in Fairhope is wonderful!!!  Citizens in Fairhope need to do some investigating about the Soccer Fields.  They say that having these fields in Fairhope will bring in tourists and they will stay in Fairhope hotels and eat at restaurants in Fsirhope and in general will shop in Fairhope .  I don't agree!  With all the Fields around Foley I cannot believe anyone would stay in Fairhope as opposed to Foley which has the Outlets and Gulf Shores at their back door with the beaches and all the things to do at the Gulf!  Wake up Fairhope!!
