 If anyone would go to a city council meeting and watch this mayor who wants to spend, spend, then you will come to the realization that we are all in trouble. 

She now wants to take over the marina. "The study" that was done, it was done internally, by a political friend of the mayor's, and the mayor gave her a job, then ask her to do a study that she is not qualified to do! That study was like comparing apples to oranges, I have a hard time calling it a study. 

You have to love the mayor's Facebook posts! We monitor computers to ensure efficiencies...what she should have said was WE ONLY MONITOR THOSE THAT WERE APPOINTED BY KANT. This mayor is dangerous as they come because she doesn't realize that most do not listen to her lies. She believes her own lies! 

NO, most companies do not spy, they may block and limit where employees search or limit sites. When you spy and you obtain personal, highly sensitive information that can only be view by few, you have a major problem. This mayor is in for a lot of issues! 

Kant left this city to this mayor with the strongest balance sheet of any Baldwin County city. Burrell/Bonne help build this city and she wants to change things for the sake of change - foolish as she is.

Strike Fast! Strike Hard!
