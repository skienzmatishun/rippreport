 No one, in this Administration or the last, has clean hands.  Kant was an idiot who was exploited by landholders who saw through and exploited his weaknesses.  When Fairhope finally figured it out and voted him out, we were stupid enough to hire another mayor who is being exploited by a bunch of rabid losers with axes to grind and Desperados who will do anything/say anything to get a paycheck from their benefactor.  Please, someone, talk to Mayor Wilson and make her see that she is making a fool of herself and our lovely city.
