 I think that a lot of people may have agreed with you a few months ago; however, now that we have experienced the Mayor's new hires with their lack of education and relevant experience,  most people seem happy that the Council is putting the brakes on her.   She could have accomplished a lot but I think that she threw away the opportunity by ignoring the voters and by giving high paying jobs to her friends.
I voted for her and I am still happy that Kant is gone, but I feel cheated by Mayor Wilson......I expected integrity and didn't get it.  Just another politician with empty promises.....maybe in 2020 we can get an honest Mayor who cares about Fairhope.......or maybe sooner if Wilson is forced to resign.
