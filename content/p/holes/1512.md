 And it's WAY!!!! past time to get rid of Tucker Dorsey. This will happen. An embarrassment to all of us. He's using the God thing to the hilt just like Tripp Pittman does and also is unethically  awarding himself contracts and getting rich off the citizens of Baldwin County and MR. DUI Baldwin County Commissioner CHRIS ELLIOTT who still lies and twist the story.  Just watch and learn. Clean wipeout....That will be the Lord's doing. These Alabama politicians are done!!!!  Let not forget about the Fairhope City Council!  Matter of time!!!  Look up how many LLC and new companies have been formed between these 3 and the city councilmen. Dozens and Dozens!!!  Look it up. One has a dozen himself just during the past 2 years. You don't have to keep creating different companies to do business honestly. It's only meant for the dishonest people who keep on and on creating new LLC's.
