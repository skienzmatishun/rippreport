 If you look at where the soccer fields were built, you can see the wickedness of the GOoBers ways.  They built the fields on a sloped land. They brought in millions of dollars in dirt dug from Tucker Dorsey's fields in Silver Hill/Robertsdale. Then they bilked the city more millions for "leveling".  This is one of the biggest scams Kant/Burrell/Boone committed.
