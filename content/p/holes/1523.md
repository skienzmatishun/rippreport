 To show just how naive this mayor is "....I will not agree to pay one dime of tax-payer money (or money from the Cityâ€™s insurance company) to anyone for this purpose..." If the insurance company wants to settle in an effort for limiting exposure then the insurance company will settle, should the mayor refuse to settle then the insurance company will stop defending the action and the city will be on its own! This statement alone shows just how inexperienced the mayor is! Duh, Duh! 

The council has to agree to pay not the mayor! Hear ye, hear ye, the queen has arrived, now move along, go about your business! I have directed the attorneys to do this, I have directed the attorneys to do that, move along, go about your business now! 

All you mayor supporters need to realize what you elected. AND now the council has to support in defending her because they want what is best for the city. Lord help her, please! 

Strike Fast! Strike Hard!
