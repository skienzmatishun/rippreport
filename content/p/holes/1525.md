 Fairhope. It's a beautiful place but if anyone was ever held accountable to the Open Meeting Act it would be a ghost town. The city would not exist as is without the FSTC. No one remembers when FSTC tried to dissolve and become a For-profit cooperation in the late seventies. Let that sink in. If not for a few farmers/leasees living outside City limits and Alabama Supreme Court all 4,400 acres of colony would be privately owned. Pretenting to live in Utopia is nothing more than a smoke screen created by folks with special interest.
