 Could someone please break down the cost of soccer field in Fairhope?  How - just how in the world could that have cost $7 million ???  I want to know WHO got paid this - Every one of them from  the landowner on down.  It is out in the middle of no where.  The land could not have been outrageous - unless a bunch of kick backs were given - clearing property, putting asphalt down to make parking, lights, field goals, fence - give me a break - just WHO ALL was STUPID enough to spend that kind of money??  We want accountability of every penny of where this money went!!
