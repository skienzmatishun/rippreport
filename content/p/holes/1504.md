 This mayor is so out of touch with reality; she has the personality of rattlesnake and the intelligence of an amoeba! Fake to the core! Foolish! This council with the exception of Conyers is the only thing that has kept Fairhope on the tracks, and the carpetbaggers realize this the better. Those are jealous of the GOBs need to get over it, if the city so bad with the GOBs in officer then why do all the carpetbaggers want to move here? We built it, now live with it! 

Strike Fast! Strike Hard! (find your own motto, do not steal this one, unless you have earned the right)
