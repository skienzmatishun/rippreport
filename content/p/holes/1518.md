 I will agree with you somewhat about the Mayor. But it doesn't change a damn thing with the others. The Mayor could make a mistake everyday. But, will not catch up to the crap that has been proven right before our eyes by the sleaze bags who have screwed all of us and then publicly as God what to do about it. God is going to punish them. Dorsey, Pittman and Elliott. Cannot have a normal conversation with anyone without thinking what are they themselves going to get out of it. Check the records of LLC filed in Alabama. It's a disgrace. Tucker Dorsey even saying at on time that his company didn't suppy dirt to the soccer field. His new LLC's did. While firing some of the best people we had in the court house in Baymintte. Come forward. Those scare to lose their jobs or have already lost their jobs because of Tucker Dorsey. Ask Frank Burt if he didn't even order Tucker to do some of the firing. Thank the Fairhope Councilmen for all the screwups and talking to all of us like we are a bunch of ignorant people. Wow!  Still need the Middle School student to run the city. Watch Trippman's  and Elliott's percentage of votes in the upcoming election. You won't be able to say we were wrong and we won't even say we told you so.
