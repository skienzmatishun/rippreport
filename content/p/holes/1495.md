 The soccer fields in fairhope cannot compete with those in foley and orange beach. they are not able to draw large tourneys. it's too late. fairhope missed the boat. but those communities have another edge. they don't pump raw sewage into the bay. and their city councils aren't run by the goobers. fairhope spent seven million total on those fields. foley built a world class facility for four million. fairhope looks so dumb. out of touch. why do the people not say anything and let the goobers run in it to the ground? so sad. you can see it is slipping. the soccer field thing stinks to high heaven for sure. No accountability as usual.
