 Come on Sherry. You and the gals  move on!  If the Pope came in as the New Mayor of Fairhope. Darn, that's scary. Think of all the snakes that would have to sliver away. He would have the same authority to remove or replace anyone working directly under his new administration. That's what so many people cannot understand and that's why the Good ole boys GOB of the council are screaming at the top of their lungs about how terrible the Mayor is doing her job. Well. She wasn't given an ounce of support and with all the lies the entire council have made publicly! They have to throw the crap against the wall and hope it sticks. The council lies at every meeting. Just come to one. They will lie to your face and you will be belittled. No matter if you have lived in Fairhope for 60 days or 60 years. They are destroying Fairhope and any little effort made by the New Mayor, the council flips upside down and blames her for everything. Not right. Take the blame for your mistakes and you might????? become stronger and hopefully will become more honest and wiser. The part that has been missing is the honesty that had no presence during the last election. No truer advise that this council could bend an ear towards. Promise you that when that one council person gets stung. There will be at least 2 that won't be smart or fast enough without getting stung also.
