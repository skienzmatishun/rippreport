Catalyst is a political cancer found in Baldwin County. It hand picks political candidates. Catalyst was formally Stacy Elliott and Haygood, the birth of the cancer, that morphed into Catalyst when Mr. Chris Elliott became a county commissioner and Haygood became the Mayor of Daphne. Catalyst represents the old guard or good ole boys. They carefully “select” candidates to represent their interests and place them in as many different races as possible. From probate judge to State Senate seats and all four Baldwin County commission races.

Catalyst’s plan is simple: Place as many candidates in as many positions as possible. That’s how shady deals like the county Mega-Site are made. At the helm of Catalyst is Mr. Scott Boone, Fairhope Councilman Kevin Boone’s son. That bad apple did not fall far from the tree. Catalyst boldly uses intimidation and bully tactics to discourage viable candidates or elected officials who may not agree with them. A lot of that information is fed to Chuckee Cheeze of the failing Gulf Coast News, who will print anything Catalyst wishes.

A classic example is Chuckee’s latest article where he gives the Three Bees press coverage to criticize the hiring of a police officer, a highly qualified individual; but hey he ain’t Catalyst.

Questions have arisen about the announced hiring of Alabama Ethics Commission Chief Special Agent Tony Goubil by Fairhope Mayor Karin Wilson for the city’s police department, after it was …

Please be advised Mr Goubil was an investigator for the Alabama Ethics Commission and had no voice in any decision the Ethics Commission made. He also investigated the Airport scandal involving Mr. Jack Burrell and Mr. Ray Hix, and that my friends is the problem the Three Bees really have. The Three Bees carry the Catalyst cancer cells and they will spread the cancer throughout Baldwin County, unless the court of public opinion wakes up and votes them out. Here is three classic examples of Catalyst members that are presently stinging the s--- out of the citizens of Fairhope. First up is grandpa Catalyst, Kevin Boone the Fairhope conduit to Chuckee Cheeze and Catalyst.

Catalyst candidates are financed by Prebble -Rish, an engineering company, and long time partner of Kevin Boone, in multiple LLC’s listed on the Alabama Secretary of State website. This is how the cancer spreads. Here are a few articles about Grandpa Boone.

Then we have Jack Burrell, who has completely gone off the rails since he entered politics almost seven years ago. Mr. Burrell was represented by an attorney, paid for by the Airport Board, involving an Ethics complaint. He now is being represented by the city’s insurance carrier in a case involving public participation. He is using your tax money to defend his unconstitutional actions. He denied the mayor that same privilege.

That’s your money taxpayers! Here are some of “come fly with me” Burrell’s accomplishments.
