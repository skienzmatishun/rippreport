The wheels of justice move slow, especially when the good ole boys knock out the spokes. 15 months ago we reported on an incident that should have been resolved in 6 months.

## BARSTOOL

### BARSTOOL | THE RIPP REPORT / BALDWIN COUNTY LEGAL EAGLE

How does someone with multiple convictions, on probation, with a 180 day jail sentence hanging over their head, continue to avoid justice?

Fairhope Municipal Court and the City Attorney dropped the ball, or hid the ball.

## WATERING HOLE

### WATERING HOLE – THE RIPP REPORT

How does a bar owner, continuously break the law and walk? If you are Ronan McSharry it appears not to be a problem.

Now the case has moved to Circuit Court and the wheels are coming off.

How does McSherry demand so much obstruction?

Why would a Circuit Judge act in such a way for what has become such a high profile case?

Any time I’ve found myself in a courtroom, I’m reminded just how important it is to have qualified judges who don’t let power and position make them crazy. Jurists should be held to a very, very high standard, because the last thing society needs is judges who either aren’t smart enough to do their jobs …

McSherry’s attorney James Pittman wants to float conspiracy theories and challenge the state’s Shield Law. Pittman is blaming everyone else, except McSherry.

In a move that appears to be unprecedented, a Baldwin County Circuit Court judge has ordered Lagniappe reporters to turn over private communications with protected sources at the request of an attorney trying to prove there’s a conspiracy to defame his client, Fairhope bar owner Ronan McSharry.
