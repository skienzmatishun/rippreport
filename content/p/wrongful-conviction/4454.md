Lets take a gander at who Frank Burt is running against in the district 1 county commission race... Jeb Ball, the program director for the Baldwin Substance Abuse Services Inc. in Bay Minette, and in my opinion, Bell becoming a county commissioner might facilitate a big conflict of interest since his business looks to be pretty much based on one customer, the county., And many of the people that fall into the cracks of the county and municipal court system, regardless of the severity of the offensive, usually end up paying dearly for drug and alcohol tests provided by Ball, this includes expensive, and useless alcohol and anger management classes mandated by judges, services that y put effaces on city and county coffers, and personal pockets, than actually helping those that they deem need it. Without going into the details of the services he provides the county The bigger questions I have for this candidate is , how much money is generated for the county by the Substance Abuse Services, and is any of the Abuse Services income obtained by outside businesses and the general public?. Or does this business solely depend on county and city court contracts ? And if the latter is true, will Mr Bell hold onto this monopoly while serving the commission? .I wonder if the substance abuse service contract is even bid out to other providers? How would having influence over county legislation and contracts as a commissioner affect his business in the future?. Will he do the right thing and let this gold mine go if elected? Well if I were a betting man, this would be a no brainer. With a large portion of our county commission already corrupted with outside special interests, I dont think we need more of the same. Frank Bert may be old news politically here in Baldwin County, but he has no apparent agenda but to serve his constituents, As far as Mr Ball is concerned, I am suspicious to say the least
