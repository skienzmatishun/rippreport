 By the way. Why are we all of seeing catalyst Baldwin County Commissioner Chris Elliott in the newspaper and in tv more lately. Doesn’t the tv stations and the print media know that we have had enough of this Drunk. I guess most people including Commissioner Elliott has forgotten just not long ago getting a DUI and telling the world what a wonderful person he is and that he never even got a DUI. Well, I can tell you one thing. You follow this catalyst group of people around and no one should be stopped for drinking and driving. It’s Elliott’s, Tucker Dorsey and Jack Burrell’s favorite pastime. If they would stop drinking and driving and also stop thinking they are the people who run this County and treat the citizens of Baldwin County like shit. They might end up not being so hated. Pathetic group of men!!!!
