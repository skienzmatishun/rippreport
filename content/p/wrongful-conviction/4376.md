 The local newspapers are no longer journalistic endeavors.   Even McCollough is a sellout.  He is a joke.  I look at Gulf Coast newspapers on sale at the convenience stores  and think of toilet paper.   What a joke.  The founding fathers wrote the First Amendment and McCullough has trashed it.  Until they fire him I will not buy the paper. It is garbage
