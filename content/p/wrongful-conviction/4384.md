 Just read March 7th Gulf Coast News &amp; Robert Browns comments - Brown needs to know the majority of Fairhope does NOT give him (Brown) much credit.  We do Not trust Brown nor the other Fairhope Council members.  Also, who cares that Pitman is spelled with 1 "t" &amp; not 2 !!!  Yes what he is doing IS for his benefit.  Ripp does not mislead - he tells the TRUTH &amp; is getting all the mess that has been going on in Fairhope out in the open.  Just who does Brown think he (Brown) is fooling??!
