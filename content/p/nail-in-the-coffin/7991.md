 Hey Big Al why don’t you stop drinking Burrell’s koolaid (or whatever you call his “juice”) and admit that you really do not care about Fairhope because you all make money off the destruction of this town by selling off what many of us have built up?
I say follow the money and you and your hypocritical Christian conservative phonies are bad people on their knees in front of these crooks
