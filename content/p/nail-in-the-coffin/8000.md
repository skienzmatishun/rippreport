 Hey Big Al Rules!  Get you head out of your ass. Wait a minute. Get your head out of Burrell’s ass, then get your head out of you own ass. You are right. It’s a steal at 2.6 million. A steal from the citizens of Faihope. It might not be a steal if it was properly purchased. Should have had more discussions and LEGITIMATE paperwork including a plan and more than one appraisal. Dumb ass!  Big Al rules!  Yea, a legend in your own mind!  You must frequent the gully as well. You are actually thinking you are important to this community. Just another pimple on Burrell’s butt!  You’ll get popped one day.
