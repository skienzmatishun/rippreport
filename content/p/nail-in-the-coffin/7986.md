 Plenty of community involvement.  See all of the Pubilc Rec board meetings and Council work sessions. Very clear the entire Board and the entire Council favored the 113 acres and not the way overpriced 40 in a bad location.  The walkability song and dance is more of Karins BS.  If she ever visited Volanta or any Park for that matter, she would know that nobody and I mean nobody walks to the ballpark.  Families haul bats, bags, water, chairs, dogs, fans, coolers etc ....nobody walks.  2.6mill is a steal and will serve Fairhope for 100 years or more.  Walk if you want ...you will be alone.
