 'Bad area' to you meaning primarily African American and therefore less entitled to have any of their tax dollars spent in their area of town?  I don't have a dog in the fight as to which property was chosen for the park, but I did see many residents advocate for a park in the area that doesn't have many public amenities.  I was surprised that, once again, Burrell and his posse did not even consider doing something good for a part of town in which they don't reside.  Of course, they don't have a council person representing them.  Pretty sad state of affairs.
