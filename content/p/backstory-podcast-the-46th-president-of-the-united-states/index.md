The Media Companies/News Outlets are confident and have called the 2020 Presidential Election for Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. We discuss what is still going on at the State level where the counts continue until certified. We discuss the politics of transition and the mechanics of the bureaucracy that must be served. No pardons on the table as of tonight.
