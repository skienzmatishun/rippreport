 Baldwin County is a chump to Alabama.  Full of suburbanites just waiting to be taxed and governed;  paying mortgages on over-priced houses built with balsa-like wood; and paying a gas tax so the people in the other counties can have nice roads with Baldwin paying for it
So you folks in Baldwin need a bridge to get to Mobile?  The state will put a toll on it.  It was this topic you started waking up and took a stand
Now Baldwin County you see where someone wants to put a condo up so the movers and shakers in Montgomery can have a place to stay on the weekends    Donâ€™t like it? Then keep pushing back on outside interests running roughshod over you!!!
These bullies are not really tough as they want you to think.   Stand up for yourselves and we he bullies will fun like scalded dogs 
Just take the toll bridge for example.  When the Baldwin people stood up, the politicians and outside interests all backed off.  Even the Governor declared it dead
