This telling photo is the core group of Elliott Stacy and Haygood, from a few years ago, a political group that represents the “machine”, they are the mules. Mr. Elliott was appointed to the County Commission and Dane Haygood was elected as Mayor of Daphne, Mr Stacy retired. The group then morphed into CATALYST and Haygood and Elliott tried to stay in the shadows while maintaining status in Catalyst.

The major goal of Catalyst is to maintain three positions in Baldwin County, Mayor of Fairhope, control of the County Commission and State Senate Seat 32. In the past they had all three and ran Baldwin County in a dark closet and much the same as a criminal enterprise. The secondary goal was to place as many people on a slate of candidates, throughout the Baldwin County Government. This includes Sheriff, probate Judge, judges, County Clerk and others.

TOTAL CONTROL was the goal and total control is what they had before political erosion set in. First Mayor Wilson defeated Mayor of Fairhope Tim Can’t, then Senator Pittman decided he would take his 750,000 dollars from BP, and the citizens of the County, and wither away like a snake, that he is. The County Commission was now weakened, their contacts and contracts now in jeopardy.

CATALYST stands naked today, the citizens of Baldwin County have had enough of the entitled good ole boys. They are backed by millionaires, contractors, and builders, among others. This has been going on for the last 30 years or more, behind closed doors.

Who is in the picture? Let me give a few names: The CATALYST Queen Michelle Thomasson, Chris Elliott, Tucker Dorsey, Lynn Stacy, Tim Can’t and Scott “baby” Boone. OH I almost forgot, District Attorney Robert Wilters. Judge Wilters walked into the office without a vote being cast, while citizens sleep, thanks to CATALYST. WHO do you recognize?

 

Chris Elliott has collected over half a million dollars for his campaign. He could hit 600,000 or more before the election. VOTERS WAKE UP. The Senate Seat, he seeks, salary is 42,000 a year? Think about that!. That money has come from developers and Goat Hill. Elliott will have to have a special computer program to keep up with who all he is indebted to.

A vote for Elliott is an endorsement for unbridled growth, limited infrastructure and the promotion of CATALYST and the good ole boys.

A vote for Tucker Dorsey is a vote for Baldwin County Sewer, both stink.

VOTERS NEED TO UNITE AND REJECT ALL THREE CATALYST CANDIDATES.

PS Fairhope Councilman Kevin Boone has provided his son “baby” Scott Boone, with city information that Catalyst uses to obstruct Fairhope’s government. He has now filed a complaint with District Attorney Wilters, who is joined by “baby” Boone in the photo. This complaint is supported by W A C O radio and The Courier editor “Chuckee Cheeze”, both have CATALYST tattoos.

The Ripp Report will be also writing a complaint to the District Attorney, however we will copy the public, FBI, and Attorney General.
