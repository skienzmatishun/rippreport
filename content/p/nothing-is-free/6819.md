 Ripp if they annex you then they will have to annex the folks on Twin Beech Road and behind the hospital.   Then with the extra monorities they will have to go to district elections to guarantee minority representation
Catalyst HATES districts because they lose control of the ballot boxes 
That is why the county Commission candidates ran at large so that Catalyst could win its candidates 
I know Tucker lost but that was because Underwood had county wide support and relatives that  even Catalyst could not buy
This is one of Catalystâ€™s Archilles heal
The other Archilles heal is people finding out about this machine and the money sources
