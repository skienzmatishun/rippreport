The battle between Dr. David Northcutt and Chris Elliott has gotten ugly as the allegations and accusations fly. The stakes are high as the winner of Tuesday's runoff will be an overwhelming favorite to win the Senate seat in this Republican stronghold come November.

Elliott said the coalitions and support he's building are not all coming from Montgomery, but from Baldwin County. "Those Realtors are raising (money) right here in Baldwin County and it's coming back to my campaign," said Elliott. "You can call it special interest if you want to, but these are general contractors and road builders and nurse anesthetists and certified public accountants and the list goes on and on. I'm proud to have a wide base of support."

Elliott said his money is coming from Realtor’s, Contractors and Road Builders, that part is so true, then he adds Accountants and Nurses to deflect your attention.

Orange Beach and Gulf Shores voters, for Jeff “Judas” Boyd, were sold out. Boyd campaigned hard against Elliott only to lose the primary and become Kennon’s yard boy. He back stabbed Big Earl, he should get jail time for that, and many residents of both communities. Judas is now knocking on doors for Elliott and leaving sticky notes asking for votes for Elliott. He has become a member of Catalyst.
