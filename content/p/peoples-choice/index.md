The people’s choice or the Catalyst choice. The Ripp Report is going for the People’s Choice, David Northcutt. The Catalyst Choice Chris Elliott has raised over one half a million dollars, headed for 600,000 for a Senate Seat salary of 42,000. Damn people WAKE UP.

Elliott said the coalitions and support he's building are not all coming from Montgomery, but from Baldwin County. "Those Realtors are raising (money) right here in Baldwin County and it's coming back to my campaign," said Elliott. "You can call it special interest if you want to, but these are general contractors and road builders and nurse anesthetists and certified public accountants and the list goes on and on. I'm proud to have a wide base of support."

Elliott said his money is coming from Realtor’s, Contractors and Road Builders, that part is so true, then he adds Accountants and Nurses to deflect your attention.

Orange Beach and Gulf Shores voters, for Jeff “Judas” Boyd, were sold out. Boyd campaigned hard against Elliott only to lose the primary and become Kennon’s yard boy. He back stabbed Big Earl, he should get jail time for that, and many residents of both communities. Judas is now knocking on doors for Elliott and leaving sticky notes asking for votes for Elliott. He has become a member of Catalyst.

Baldwin County can do better than a bought and paid for Catalyst Candidate.
