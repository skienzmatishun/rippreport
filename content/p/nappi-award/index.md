The Mayor of Fairhope has won four years in a row, The Nappi Award for the

HARDEST WORKING ELECTED CITY OFFICIAL—EASTERN SHORE

MAYOR KARIN WILSON FAIRHOPE

The Mayor has received 4 Nappi Awards, during the same time the council has been awarded nothing, ZERO. The council has fought the Mayor tooth and nail for 4 years and she still accomplished, in spite of them, more in 4 years than the previous Mayor did in 16 years.

**Mayor Karin Wilson:**

 

Please read to get the facts about the work ALREADY completed to fully update our Sewer System and know, THE MOST CRITICAL UPGRADES WILL BE COMPLETED BY 2022.

This is a promise like the ones I made in 2016 for which I delivered.

Understand, the hard work to get this funded and moved forward is done. We have invested $14M in utility upgrades so far this term without borrowing a dime.

In addition, we obtained $11M to offset rehabilitating sewer lines and planning a SSO Prevention Plan for the entire Eastern Shore.

I'm extremely proud of my administration for staying the course and accomplishing so much progress. I urge you to read the following timeline most find extremely eyeopening!

Promises Made – Promises Kept End Wasteful Spending & Restore Fiscal Health

Four years ago, the city was running an annual $6 Million deficit, making payments on millions of dollars of debt, and requiring most of the profits from our Utility department to subsidize its budget.

Today, the City is fiscally self-reliant, paid off long-term debt, increased combined City/Utility cash funds by almost 60% leaving our gas, electric, water and wastewater utilities the ability to finally afford its long-ignored maintenance and upgrade needs.

In addition, my administration obtained $18M in RESTORE funds, most of which will be invested in sewer system upgrades and a sewer overflow prevention plan along the Eastern Shore - money citizens will save in sewer rate increases.

This is what fiscal responsibility looks like and will continue under my leadership as a fiscal conservative with ~30 years experience in Finance & Business Management.

This is a promise - like the ones I made in 2016 for which I delivered. Let’s stay the course moving forward together.

Vote [KarinForFairhope.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20230204122408/https://www.karinforfairhope.org/) August 2th.

In four years Mayor Wilson has accomplished more than the previous Mayor did in 16 years.
