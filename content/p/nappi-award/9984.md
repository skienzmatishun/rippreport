 I hope you are correct, Miss Perkins.  However, as long as there are greedy developers and politicians available for sale, there will ALWAYS be a conduit to hook them up.
It has been said that "Money is the mother's milk to politics."  Because of this, somebody will always be around to supply the nipple.  Today it is Catalyst.  Tomorrow it will probably be called "Christians for Conservative Government."  Like Satan, they will dress themselves up.
The answer lies in that we, the voters, must look into who we are electing into office.
