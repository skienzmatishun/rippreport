 Mister Ripp I have examined the police report for Mr. Burrell closely.
Despite its obvious redactions, it appears legitimate.

For the audience and for the sake of our democracy and good faith in your
intentions to help the City of Fairhope, would you please tell us how
the hell you got hold of THAT document?

Thank you Sir.
