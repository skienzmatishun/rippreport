 I am not Ripp, but I would venture to guess that if Catalyst answered a single question then they would just further expose their other dirty dealings.
When Catalyst, EHS, Stacy, or what ever they called themselves came to light - thanks to Ripp, they had to change their name.  This is not the first time they have had to change their name and it will not be the last.
Now that this group has been exposed, the politicians that use them are coming under scrutiny.  One candidate in Daphne lied about using Catalyst.  He said he was not using this group and it was discovered he was in fact using Catalyst (or Scott Boone Consulting).  He is now in trouble.
I look at the campaign reports, and sure enough, those candidates with the PVC campaign signs are using Scott Boone.
Catalyst thought that the voters did not care about them but the voters are connecting the dots.
