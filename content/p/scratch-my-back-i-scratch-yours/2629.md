 Jester. We can all see that you lost it along time ago. I don't think anybody wants or cares to know who you are. I also agree this has turned into to "The Jester's posting site". Congratulations. You have made this site impossible for someone to say anything at all without you posting a ridiculous opinion everytime. It's all yours.  I'm certainly not a fool like you and I'm not going to keep reading where every 2 or 3 post it's you going off on someone or some hateful BS or whatever. I think you still are fooling yourself and the people that read your post have really had enough of your vulgar and rudeness and foolishness. Again, I really don't think anyone cares who you are. We all certainly know what you are. Enjoy "your" posting site. This is only my 2nd and final post and visit. For those of you who enjoy the Jester. You deserve him and he certainly does not have any reason to say he forgives anyone. For those of you that have a few minutes? Go back and read all of Jester Triple-Six comments. If you can't understand what I'm saying?  Than this city is in more trouble than I thought and the moral meter is clicking down each day. It's your turn Jester. I won't be seeing your next post. Over and out!  People are better than you in this town no matter who they support, like or even dislike.
