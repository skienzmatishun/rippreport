 Fairhope is easily the most corrupt city in Alabama...

Rigged its mayor's races for decades...

Until one Francis "Paul" Ripp came along...

The progeny of a lifelong citizen activist and civil rights forerunner, Francis learned how to screw with politicians from one of the best--his Dad.

Dr. John Ripp terrorized Alabama Power for years and was a mainstay at the public service commission meetings, routinely speaking for the downtrodden poor and destitute who had no voice.

John Ripp died of a heart attack prottesting unfair cable increases before the Birmingham City Council in the 1980s.

Paul Ripp...unless someone shoots him...is gonna get Burrell and the rest of these idiots ruining Fairhope.

Hemi out.
