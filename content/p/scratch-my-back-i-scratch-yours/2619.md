 Everything is set by the tone of The Ripp "Report" edition, the more kind the "Report" is the more kind everyone should be. No one is totally transparent, that is why we use a handle or Anonymous. But there are way too many Anonymous(es), at least when someone is Anonymous 2 then we know they are not one of the many Anonymous(es). 

As of this post, there are five Anonymous already on here, before long I will run out of fingers and toes to keep up with the numbers! You peoples should use handles! (Is that permissible?)

I did hear something interesting in Fairhope today, it was very interesting indeed but I am trying to play fair! Psst, psst, ya'll want to hear the latest? 

If it is permissible to say this - Strike Fast! Strike Hard!
