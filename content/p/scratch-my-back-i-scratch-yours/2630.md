 Allegations having to do with public figures are not banned. Allegations that have nothing to do with the public will be removed. I don't have an exact answer but keep in mind, your comments are your own. If law enforcement requests identifying information for a valid reason, the information will be provided. For example, if requested, we would hand over the Jester's identifying information before the Jester discovered Tor and VPNs. In that event, law enforcement would use that information to go to your ISP, such as Verizon or At&t, and get a matching name.
