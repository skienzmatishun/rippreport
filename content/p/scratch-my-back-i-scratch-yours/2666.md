 Thanks for the explanation. I can see where that could be true. I certainly agree with you on the obama care. I won't even capitalize his name. I have been in business for 30 years and have had some lean years and got through the most recent economic  downturn. But obama care almost killed us and lost 2 full time employees. It's sad to see such a thief be in a position that could really help us. Gosh! We need it. I also didn't agree with Pittman wanting to increase the gas tax. We need leaders who care about US. There are very few of them in this world. Wish everyone could learn to interact on this site like we just did.  Thank you again for your return post.
