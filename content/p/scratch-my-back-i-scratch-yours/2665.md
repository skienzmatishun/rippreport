 He stated that he opposes the bill because the cost of if will drive up already surging insurance costs.  I agree with him.  It takes Obamacare to an entirely new level of stealing from one group to subsidize another.  I believe that Trip is a fraud and a thief and have no intention of ever voting for him, but I agree with his stance on the autism bill.  People need to assume the costs of raising their own children.  Obamacare has forced us to pay for multiple drug rehabs for people who have no intention of stopping their drug use; autism treatment will become another big industry.
