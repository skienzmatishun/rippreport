 I am happy to hear that you will be deleting frivolous comments that add nothing to the discussion.  The comments to your last post were so filled with reply after reply of childish personal attacks that pretty much ruined it for those of us who actually want to participate in intelligent discourse.  It was like if the Real Housewives and the audience from Jerry Springer decided to hijack a blog.  Thank you for doing whatever it takes to assure another one of your posts does not devolve in this manner.
