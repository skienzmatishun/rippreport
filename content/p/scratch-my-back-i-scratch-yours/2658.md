 Exactly why would Trip Pittman hold back the Autism Bill. Is there anything with it that he is personally against. What in the world could he make money holding the people with Autism and their families as well almost as hostages. He has only does things that I (personally) have seen to make money or for personal gain for himself using his office. How can he make money from this?  Is he saying no until someone comes up with some cash or a favor to trade for? Thanks for any remarks. Shouldn't all these people who are affected, treating and taking care of those who have Autism and their families be disappointed or even mad with Trip Pittman? Thank you. Ripp can you explain more on this?
