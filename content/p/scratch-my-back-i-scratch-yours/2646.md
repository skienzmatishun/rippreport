 I have a simple question but, I also have a comment. I think it's very unethical for Trip Pittman to obtain all these municipalities heavy equipment contracts, the Fairhope debris removal and the BP Oil Spill contract that he (Pittman Tractor) got and should not have gotten and then on top of that! He did a rotten disgraceful job and polluted our bays by instructing the anchor ropes be cut while leaving the anchors themselves in the bay and took the money that actually covered removing the anchors also and ran Straight to the bank while screwing the public and other companies that should have gotten the contract and would have done the job right!  Just a terrible and shameless human being! My  question is, How much money has state senator Trip Pittman (Pittman Tractor) taken, in contracts since he took office???  I know he will not win the US senate seat. Don't think there are that many people left that would even consider voting for him in any capacity. I don't think I really won't to know how much he has personally screwed us citizens out of?  Can anyone give me an estimate? I kniw he has received millions?  But how much????
