 Question, is it permissible to use words like Yankee, Carpetbaggers, Scallywag or Bushwhacker? Noticed I used capital letters for each noun to show historic respect. Or is that so profound that it is going to be deleted? Why do can't everyone use a handle that way we all will know how saying what. Also, if we find something that is serious, can we point things out or is an allegation banned too? As we all an ethics complaint is an allegation and not something that has been proven, so if it is an allegation then can it be in The Ripp 'Report's" edition or commits section? Also, can someone ask a serious question that could or may raise an allegation? I am trying play fair! This remark can be deleted, I agree with Ripp of some of this edition and really appreciate how Ripp did not bash the council members this Friday. Yes, I posted that remark!
