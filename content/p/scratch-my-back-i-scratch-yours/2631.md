 Wow. Feeling sorry for the Jester. I also agree with you but, I think both of them have gotten in the way. I've gone back and read the past several articles and comments and I saw where anonymous 2 was involved in only one article. You think that Jester even had enough of anonymous 2 and you don't think Jester's comments are not hateful and disturbing. You have a problem. Let's stick with the issues and try to show what kind of people who demean, lie about, call stupid and dumbass and what color stripes should the mayor be wearing, etc, etc,  comments about 1/4 or more of all the posts. Anonymous 2 made their point during one article and if you really think those were worse than Jester's? You people are so small that I you and Jester sat on a sheet of toilet paper. Y'alls feet would be dangling. Stick to the article just as the Admin of the Ripp Report has said. Let's either clean this site up and have some great discussions without all the crap or let Jester and the madness continue on by themselves!
