 There is a difference between Paul and John Ripp, his dad did not attack individuals and was highly educated in economics. He did not call people names! He supported causes against large corporations that wanted to raise electrical rates to the poor. He had ethics, and was a good man! Unlike some, please do not compare this site to John Ripp!
