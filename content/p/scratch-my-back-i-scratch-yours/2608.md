 The comments that will be removed will be the ones that confuse or dilute the conversation. For example, impersonating each others handles adds nothing and only make things confusing. We don't need the same identical comment, Anonymous 2, over and over. All comments, aside from threats, will be allowed to remain for a minimum of 6 hours. Prior to deletion, the page will be archived automatically where anyone can view the unfiltered comments on a separate page that cannot be edited. Use the contact form to request that we re-instate a comment. Comments will always be recoverable.
