 Get Real, you are being so ugly to me!!! So ugly, I am so offended, now my feelings are hurt. AND you can not talk to me in that tone, it is not permissible anymore!

I have tried to tell everyone that I am my own man! Do you really think Paul would have asked Brown if he was Jester if Jester worked for the "Report??? Remember that fatal moment at the council meeting???

So it appears that you agree that within the edition section of the "Report" when it has been hateful, calling council members names, so those are your values? You seem to condone this hatefulness but object to my commits! It appears that you have a double standard and like to hear things from one side, but when someone points out faults of others then you are unhappy. AND that type of discussions has been going on in here for years! Perhaps you really need to 'Get Real'!

I don't think The Ripp "Report" tracks but of course, I use Tor Browser and a VPN so good luck tracking the Jester! AND I forgive you for being ugly to me with your commits, so now, are we friends again? My name is Jester Triple-Six and my address is 209.58.136.000. See, I am okay with being tracked!

Was that all permissible???

If this is permissible - Strike Fast! Strike Hard!
