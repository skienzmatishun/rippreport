SENATE RACE:

Before we get into the ugliness of the Senate race, let me address the ugliness of some comments we have been receiving. Some comments are just ignorant but the name calling, senseless rambling about allegations without any facts and violent references to elected officials and their families, will not be tolerated. These comments however do represent the vile nature of the author. It is also a classic example of how some people in Fairhope are convinced they are entitled, and the rest of us are carpetbaggers and Yankees. Please do not act like an idiot or your comments will be deleted.

The Alabama Senate race has 11 republican candidates.

{{< socialpreview url="https://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2017/05/deadline_today_for_us_senate_r.html" >}}

Jackson, Breault, Maxwell, Peeples and Gentile, who dropped out, all are virtually unknown in Baldwin County. That leaves Luther Strange, Roy Moore, Mo Brooks Tripp Pittman and Randy Brinson are left, all campaigned in Baldwin County.

Luther Strange has sold his soul just for the opportunity to live in the swamp. He let the Luv Gov walk for a plane ticket to Washington. As Alabama’s Attorney General he also let Sen Tripp Pittman keep his 750,000 dollars of BP money. His office failed to go after Pittman while dozens of citizens got caught up in BP fraud for less than 10,000 dollars. No on “small” Luther.

Roy Moore thrown off the Alabama Supreme Court for not upholding the very laws he swore he would protect. No Way! Why would you vote for someone who has been fired twice for NOT doing his job?

Mo Brooks who has stated that if Jeff Sessions was fired by President Trump and Brooks won the Senate seat, he would give the Alabama Senate seat back to Sessions. Sorry but that just sounds nuts. His commercials are not as bad as Luther’s, but they are close.

Luther, Moore and Brooks are considered the top three and are in competition to see who can out GOD the other. All three think all they have to do is be anti Obama and talk about what good Christians they are.

Sen Tripp Pittman, the worst elected official in Baldwin County, hands down. BP Pittman

## Fairhope ends contract with Senate candidate’s company - Lagniappe Mobile

![](https://cdn.rippreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/BB_Pittman.jpg)

The Fairhope City Council Monday voted to award its conditional disaster debris removal and disposal contract to the lowest responsive and responsible vendor — D&J Enterprises Inc., of Auburn — effectively ending an arrangement the city had since 2012 with State Sen. Trip Pittman, who chose not to seek another term in the Legislature this …

has used his elected office to garner many a contract within Baldwin County. He has no shame:

Folks have you ever asked yourself “Who elected these people, how did they get elected?” Well, we the citizens are responsible for that. None of the above is really much of a choice.

The dark horse in the race is Randy Brinson and his best qualification is he is not a career politician.

The Ripp Report will be following the Senate race and we hope to inform the rest of Alabama just how damn bad Sen. Pittman has been for Baldwin County and how sending him to the swamp would be the worst decision they ever made.
