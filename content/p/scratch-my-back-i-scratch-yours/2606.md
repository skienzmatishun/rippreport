 Personally, I would find it more enjoyable if the comments that don't add anything are removed. He never said he will remove anti mayor supporter's comments.  Ripp could have made it so all comments have to be approved but he doesn't. How are 20 identical comments praising Jester doing anything but getting in the way?
