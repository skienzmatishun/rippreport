 Question - what is deemed a threat? I have never said that I would beat up anyone, but many have said they want to beat me up so is that a threat! Is it a threat to say something like I am going to file an ethics complaint or contact the IRS? Some may see this as a promise and not a threat. Then again, if someone figures out who the Jester is they will try and beat me up so that could be seen as a promise too. Trying to understand the rules of engagement here, after all, this is the new more kind Jester. Oh, I guess the word 'fool' is not permissible either??? AND Jester will drop his Triple-Six! See Jester is showing good faith. Or should I???
