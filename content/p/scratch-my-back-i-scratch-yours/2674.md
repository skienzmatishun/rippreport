 Actually, that was only one person'a response.  The Mayor went on to explain more, including but not limited to efforts to pull those who are not in the city limits in to be able to contribute their fair share financially, as they should.  Maybe you just tuned out when the Mayor started speaking.  I felt for an hour-and-a-half presentation, a LOT was covered and explained.  It's great that so many folks showed up with fair questions and participation and I look forward to more.
