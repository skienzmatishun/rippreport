 So much to say about your post.  First, no one needed a ticket for the town hall meeting last night.  Now, when you start off your missive with a lie, it makes it so I don't even want to read any further but I guess I'm a masochist when it comes to following through, even drivel.  I take exception with your declaration that "most in Fairhope knows (blah blah blah)".  You can only speak for yourself and the small group of people in your orb.  Please do not try to speak for me or so many others who do not agree with you.  And as far as saying that the city council members are not the bad guys, I only have to say: be patient.  The truth ALWAYS comes out, even if it's not as fast as we would like.
