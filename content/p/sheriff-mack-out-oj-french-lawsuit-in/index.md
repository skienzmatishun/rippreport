The Family of OJ French Jr, the Bay Minette Justice League, and The French Family Legal Counsel May Jung LLC held a rally on July 31, 2024 where they revealed that they had filed a lawsuit in Federal Court against the City of Bay Minette and Officer Brandon Thompson. Mr. French revealed to the attendees that Mayor Robert Bob Wills lied when he said that he spoke for the family and further stated that they were "ok with the outcome" of the investigation and that this would no longer be at topic of conversation at the request of the family, which is apparently untrue. According to the lawsuit the Officer did not have probable cause for the stop and escalated the situation by demanding that the victim get out of the car. There was then apparently a struggle over a taser and Bay Minette Police Officer Brandon Thompson (acting on your behalf) shot this young man killing him. The fact that this video is not a public record should be a call to action to throw these bastards out, bottom to top- from Mayor Wills to the Legislators who rent his office and any Judge who thinks this video is a Grand Jury Secret, The Grand Jury has seen it and the Officer was cleared. No need to oust the Sheriff because he announced mid July that he is resigning mid August and wants Chief Deputy Anthony Lowery to be appointed to fill out the reminder of his term by Governor Ivey (Whitehouse-like-geriatrics-aside). Then enters County Commissioner Matt McKenzie who also wants the post. This is a major opportunity to moderately interrupt the BOSS HOGG influence in Baldwin County. Write to the Governor and ask her to not appoint Deputy Anthony Lowery (previously discussed in the DEAL WITH THE DEVIL CASE). In the mean time Trump got shot, Biden dropped out of the race, and Alabama intends to legislate that sharks must stay away from the Alabama shore. Mayor Wills and The Major Crimes Unit of Baldwin County are about to learn why the Old Indian Wisdom rings true.
