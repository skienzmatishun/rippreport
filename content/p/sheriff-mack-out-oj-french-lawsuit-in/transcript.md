# Transcript

Less than 48 hours after an assassination attempt, Federal Judge Eileen Cannon ruled Special Counsel Jack Smith’s prosecution of Donald Trump for classified documents unconstitutional. Cannon declared the appointment of a special counsel without congressional authorization violates the Constitution’s appointments and appropriations clauses, asserting such offices reside in Congress, not the executive branch. She rejected the DOJ’s argument that Attorney General Merrick Garland could appoint a special counsel independently, citing a 93-page ruling and a concurring opinion by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. The decision effectively stalled the prosecution, invalidating its legal foundation and leaving the case without standing. Prior to this, the 11th Circuit had already vacated the appointment, deeming a special master to review Mar-a-Lago materials unnecessary and a violation of transparency. FBI agents seized a trove of sensitive documents from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in August 2022, prompting a scene where Trump joked about adding a lock to a room the FBI had helped secure—agents later had to cut the lock off. Trump, as president, had plenary declassification authority, meaning he could have declared documents declassified. Critics argue the case reflects political targeting, with the prosecution relying on fabricated evidence—staged printed cover sheets and fake top-secret documents—making the photo evidence appear like propaganda. Trump was found guilty of 34 counts, primarily falsifying business records, but the conviction hinges on a secondary crime that remains unproven. In a separate case, Judge Cannon effectively condemned the Georgia election interference case, allowing Fannie Willis to stay but signaling the case must be tossed on appeal. The ruling, seen as a major victory for Trump, follows a pattern of judicial skepticism toward the prosecution’s legitimacy and procedural flaws. The decision underscores constitutional limits on executive power and the role of Congress in official appointments. While the government may appeal, the core legal basis for the special counsel’s existence is rejected. The ruling marks a significant escalation in judicial scrutiny of the DOJ’s use of special counsel authority.
