 Paul, I fully support your rights to your opinions.  Please be attentive to reporting facts and be aware of your attention to detail.   For example, in your post dated March 3, 2017, you filed an AL Ethics Commission form with you listed as the "Respondent" rather than the "Complainant".  You cannot have another individual file a complaint against you.  This type of sloppiness will continue to dilute your credibility with your readers.

Paul, I use your newsletter as a resource before I start my independent research.  Please be factual.  Please do not personally attack those individuals courageous enough to publicly represent the citizens of Fairhope.

Sincerely,

Gene Bouchillon
