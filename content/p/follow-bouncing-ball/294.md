 I appreciate the things that the RIPP report brings to light. The substantial documents that you've uncovered on your own time is very appreciative. People it's good for the residents of Fairhope to understand what's happening in our town and with our city council. But do more than just read these blogs and leave your comments. Show up to the council meetings. Hear them bully our Mayor (it's gross how they collectively treat her). See in person how Burrell and Boone really do not care about what's best for Fairhope or the residents. They care about themselves. Will you be there Monday?
