 I challenge all citizens of Fairhope to watch the March 27th Work Session &amp; Council Meeting.  Everyone needs to see the actions of Jack Burrell &amp; Kevin Boone.  Jack criticizes social media - we will all gladly stop &amp; get on video &amp; on Record for all citizens to see - Do we care where Jack came from before he wore a "tie" no we do not - we care about his actions now - in the present - let us all get together to see what we can do to impeach Jack Burrell &amp; Kevin Boone!!!
