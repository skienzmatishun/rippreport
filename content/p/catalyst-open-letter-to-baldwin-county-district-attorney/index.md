Open letter to Baldwin County District Attorney

District Attorney Robert Wilters

Dear sir:

I recently read an article in the Gulf Coast news, Courier, about City Councilman Kevin Boone submitting a complaint to your office in reference to Fairhope Mayor Wilson. Mr. Boone chose to use the paper to make his complaint public and the radio station WABF 1480 AM, aka WACO radio, to echo the same complaint.

http://gulfcoastnewstoday.com/stories/fairhope-councilman-accuses-mayor-wilson-of-violating-state-law,64372

It should be noted that this is just another attempt to unseat a duly elected official to satisfy the needs of a shadow government, Catalyst. Catalyst should be investigated as well as the Courier and WACO radio for their part in obstructing Fairhope Government.

https://rippreport.com/p/shadow-government/

Mr. Boone, WACO radio and the tabloid news, Courier, are representatives of the group Catalyst. Mr Boone’s son Scott runs the dubious group and uses these media outlets to further their cause. Mr Kevin Boone says he is acting as a concerned citizen not a council person, yet the title of the article says “Fairhope Councilman accuses Mayor Wilson of violating the law.”

If Mayor Wilson is guilty of a crime, Baldwin County Sheriff Hoss Mack would also be guilty. The accusation is baseless and neither party needs to worry about breaking any laws. I do find it interesting that the complaint was sent to your office and not the Secretary of State or Ethics Commission.

Mr. Wilters many people believe your position as District Attorney was aided by Catalyst. Your support for Mr Lynn Perry for Probate Judge, a catalyst candidate, is also well known. It is also well known that you discouraged Harry D’Olive from running for Probate Judge, who ended up winning. Your history with Catalyst should require that your office recuse itself from any allegations Mr. Boone dreams up.

Fairhope City Councilman and Catalyst member, Kevin Boone should be the one investigated for his relationship with John Avant and the many LLC’s they share. Mr. Jack Burrell is another Councilman with plenty of baggage. Investigate the Fairhope Airport. Let’s not forget Mr Robert Brown, another Fairhope City Councilman who secured a no bid contract with the Fairhope Art Center, where he is a board member.

The Ripp Report has considerable documentation that raises many red flags. We, however do not have the investigative powers of your office. We cannot put them on the stand a swear them in, nor can we convene a grand jury.

The Ripp Report has written about these issues for years. Those accused remain silent and those charged to investigate corrupt elected officials steer clear of their responsibilities.

I have included 88 articles by the Ripp Report that outline a multitude of allegations against these Councilman. The articles also link Lagniappe and Al.com articles related to the posts.

Sometime it is easier to prosecute an impaired bus driver than to go after corrupt elected officials.
