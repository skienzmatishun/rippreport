 I guess that since the Anonymous here doesn't seem to think that anything is being done wrong in Fairhope, is clearly benefiting financially from the Fairhope Airport or the ridiculous subpar soccer fields that have cost double or even more than what they are actually worth. Or, are you just one of the many, (emphasis on "many"), stupid human beings that have allowed this corruption and insane behavior of the Fairhope Council to continue. If you think just because the pathetic members of the Alabama's Ethics Committee has ruled against a complaint filed by virtually anyone and everyone in the entire State of Alabama is correct. You are again, sadly mistaken. We have spent 20 times or more of the difference of what another better suited and a more level piece of property would have cost us, just on hauling in ridiculous amounts of DIRT alone!!!  Most ignorant thing I have witnessed during the 50 years that I have lived in Fairhope. The new soccer complex, if you can give the name that much credit, is a joke on us and to everyone else in every city in Alabama as they too realize how stupid we seem to be by spending and wasting millions of dollars just to enrich the Fairhope Councilmen and their friends while leaving us with joke of a complex!!!  It would appear that you are a crook and don't give two cents about the betterment of the city of Fairhope's future. You along with your clan just want to take the money and run. Pathetic trash!!!
