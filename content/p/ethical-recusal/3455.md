 Paul, it seems like when someone doesn't side with you they are crooks. Why is that? There are a lot of people, a whole lot [emphasis added], that does not agree with you. So why is it that every time you have filed a complained it has been dismissed? Is it because everyone that rules against you is a crook? Or, are they unbiased and rule fairly? Or, is it you do have the ability to file a complaint correctly, and you and others around you think they have facts but it is merely gossip. Paul, perhaps you need to find a different hobby and do something more productive with your life.
