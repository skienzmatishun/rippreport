 Paul, can you hear that drumbeat? Your credibility is now non-existent, every complaint you have filed has been determined to not have merit. You have made it easier for the ones that decide to seek reelection to be elected. If you had not filed your complaint then the rumors and gossip you seem to manufacture could have hurt the candidates, the council members would not have a third party independent party rule ruling.  As of today, they have a great rebuttal to all of the gossip and lies that spew from this site. You can talk, talk, and then talk more, and all a council member has to do is hold up the letter stating your complaint was dismissed. I was serious about you finding a new hobby, I know you want to be like your father but the reality of the situation is, you will never enjoy his reputation. I hate to break the news to you but you really need to focus on the mayor's office, her issues then you may get an ethics complaint accepted and ruled in the light you desire.
