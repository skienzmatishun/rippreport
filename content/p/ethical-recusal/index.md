"The Ivey Gambit", playing to the base related to an Executive Order against Biden's vaccine mandate- and all the grandstanders want a shot at this one.

We recount the Lagniappe article "Nowhere Fast" related to "The Ethical Recusal" of a Montgomery County Circuit Judge in the Francis Paul Ripp v The Alabama Ethics Commission Case related to the involvement of Ethics Director (Tom Albritton) on cases Mr. Ripp alleges were not properly investigated (all Baldwin County Cases-big surprise).

There is a push for a new Baldwin County Planning District 8 outside of Fairhope and North of Point Clear, signatures are being collected as required. The Sheriff cant get no help (meaning the Baldwin County Sheriff Huey Mack).

And Gulf Shores is not only advocating for a new bridge but also spending $9 Million of BP money on a "mosquito buffet" aka nature park in the wetlands behind the high school. Genius. And SARS-COV-2 isn't over 45,936,524 Infected in the USA with 745,565 Deaths.
