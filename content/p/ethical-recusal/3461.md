 We demand to know the names of the ones that are on the Ethics Commission.  Can we not go above them since they are obviously intertwined with these crooks in Fairhope?   Everyone that knows of all the crap that has gone on in Fairhope for years - even prior to Kant  needs to step forward.   I as well as many others would contribute to Ripp for having the courage to bring a lot of this mess out in the open.  The Ethics Commission needs to go also - they obviously know Kant &amp; have been meeting with him.
