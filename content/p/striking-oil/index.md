Tom Albritton and Regions Bank struck oil in Conecuh County. The population of the county is around 12,000. I guess Tom and the Bank saw no need to tell the citizens of the county or the relatives of Mabel Amos.

Why should they?

It was their oil well.

As director of the Alabama Ethics Commission, Tom Albritton is the state’s policeman for conflicts of interest and ethical breaches that can arise throughout all levels of government, but having a private charitable trust he helps oversee pay more than $100,000 for his kids’ college tuition is r...

The grandniece of former Alabama Secretary of State Mabel Amos is incredulous that her own daughter has been denied college money from a multimillion-dollar charitable trust set up by her beloved great aunt while the children of one of the men tasked with running it had more than $100,000 of tuition paid from the fund...

“Between 2002 and 2018, Regions Bank brought in more than $1 million for managing the trust. IRS 990 filings from the Mabel Amos Memorial Fund show Regions averaged five hours of work per week on the fund and that it paid the bank close to half as much as it distributed in scholarships during that time.

'This is the deal. Obviously, oil was struck in 2010. The only person I ever talked to was John Bell. I talked to John Bell from 1999 on forward all the time about getting these kids through school,' Manning said of one of the trustees who worked in Regions Bank’s trust division.“

In addition to the Lagniappe articles, The Ripp Report has filed an ethics complaint, Writ of Mandamus, filed a Bar complaint and sent the Alabama Attorney General Office a copy of said complaints. No TV news channels or and other news agency is covering the story, other than Lagniappe and the Ripp Report.

The Ripp Report, so far, has had no response from any of the agencies. It was interesting to see Mr Albrittion this week teaching lobbyists ethics while he is under a thunderstorm of ethical and legal violations. Tom Albrittion, Director of Ethics, awarded his daughters $105,000 in scholarships from a trust he helps manage.

He should not be lecturing anyone about ethics. He needs to be investigated, thrown off the trust and refund the money he “legally” skimmed.

One thing that did happen is Leigh Manning, the grandniece of Mabel Amos, Former Sec of State. Has retained an attorney. Not just any attorney, a very good attorney. This is a game changer.

“Manning has hired well-known Montgomery attorney Thomas Gallion to look into the matter. Gallion, who has represented Manning’s mother before and knew her father well, also said Amos was close to his parents. He waded right in when it came to offering an assessment of the handling of the Mabel Amos Memorial Fund. “

 Mr Gallion is the author of:

Read his book and you will understand, that Mr. Gallion, has a history of knowledge about Alabama political corruption.

Regions Bank, Mr. Tom Albrittion and Rick Clifton, the three “trustees” now have a serious problem, a legal problem.
