 It certainly is interesting that all of the catalyst council men claim to be Christian and to above all else--espouse Christian Judeo values. Each of these men before they were elected promised to not take public contracts. That hollow promise was complemented by their ill treatment of the mayor, who they tell everyone is "crazy" while they do everything in their power to subvert hers and ruin the town.  The old adage says that "Power corrupts. Absolute Power corrupts absolutely.

If Fairhope is a Christian town, or a town made up largely of people who believe in Christ and in his teachings, then how can it support this council? Perhaps the council men believe people see them truly as good Christians...and that the people understand it is what they should believe over all else...or maybe we see through their bullshit, greed and lies.

Just maybe, for Fairhope's sake.
