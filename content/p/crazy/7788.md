 Mayor Wilson has far fewer skeletons than Tim Kant. In perspective,  Karin Wilson may have a 'dime size dent'  but former Mayor Kant pretty much 'totalled' Fairhope and I would be shocked if anyone would spend a vote for him or Sherry Sullivan.  One can only steal so much from one community and return to do it again.  I don't know that either of them did it to line their own pockets, but it appeared to me that Corte owned them completely along with Jennifer Fidlar.  Mayor Wilson has tried to even the playing field here so that one does not have to be buddies with one of them to be treated equally here.
Clearly the good old boys can't deal with fairness and truth.
