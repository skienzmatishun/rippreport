 Violet,  we need to be reminded that Catalyst is not just the Fairhope  Council.  Catalyst also claims the County Commission, other city councils, many of the sitting judges, and now a State Senator who used Catalyst to get into office with the agreement that they would do the developers’ biddings.   We see this in Norton’s rulings, allowing Corte and Cox and Prebble to allow their plans to be approved
We also see this when Elliott’s was going to allow the P3 to make us pay to use our own roads until the people pushed back
Catalyst is a multiheaded snake.  Scott Boone is only a front man.   Besides he isn’t that smart to run such an empire
When Ripp exposed this outfit and I conducted my own research on this outfit.   It is powerful and can only be beaten by the people- if they care
Every time Catalyst gets mentioned is like turning on the light and watching the cockroaches scurry
