 I’m neither for or against Kant. But!!  If you miss Kant, then you need to find the true meaning of what being a good person is?  A good person does not do evil for that many years and brag about it while ripping down the very fine city of Fairhope for years. “Devious” you spat out with your forked tongue?  If you die and go to hell I hope you will forgive yourself for just being plain stupid. If you end up in heaven, I’ll explain everything to you. You MISS Kant?  Now that’s what this article is all about. “Crazy” Go to church for heavens sakes. Good people is not something you can associate Kant with or even yourself for that matter.  Get a life!
