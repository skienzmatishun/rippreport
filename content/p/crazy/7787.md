 What do you mean that 'she has visions for people she wants to attract to Fairhope'.  I haven't read or heard anything about her trying to attract anyone; she is concerned with our 'long past its sell date' infrastructure and has worked ceaselessly to get Jack Burrell and the rest of the Council to approve funds to update same to support the runaway development in our City.  The 3 or 4 former employees who were fired, I bet, were fired for good cause.   I have heard that they were all Kant 'pets' who were no longer enjoying Kant benefits  and were no longer working for the good of the City.    I don't know the Mayor personally but I do watch/attend council meetings and I see that Jack Burrell is so jealous of her that he would prefer to destroy Fairhope rather than give her a fair shot.
