 I talk frequently to many city employees.  They love the Mayor and always say that she is concerned about their needs and that she listens to their problems and tries to help.   I bet that the complainers are those who were high on the totem pole in the Kant administration.  The ones to whom I have listened have been much lower on that pole and they praise Karin Wilson for trying to get them what they need to do their jobs, but they believe that the City Council wants the entire sewer system to fail before the next election so that they can blame Mayor Wilson.  I could certainly see Burrell trying to 'engineer' that.
