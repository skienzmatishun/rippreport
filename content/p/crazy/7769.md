 Just a quick google search, because your poorly written rants warrant no more effort than that, and one will see that there is no "statistical" evidence to support your "statistical fact". At least not in the top 6 articles that discuss state corruption. I'm not saying I always disagree with you, but your arguments lose credibility when you assign un-proven or inmeasurable value to them. It does make for entertaining reading though. You do seem to have the Mayor's ear, though. Perhaps to reach the highest level of success she can, she might try to earn the loyalty of those employees she "leads". At large, she doesn't have it. She is not trusted and is viewed as unpredictable and spiteful by those who work for her. I'm certainly not banging the council's drum or singing their tune in this comment....it's just a couple of thoughts of mine.
