Sit back and enjoy our primary preview of the Republican sample ballot. If you are sick and tired of the status quo....endlessly recycled Democrats in Republican clothing, vote the former Democrat and Don Siegleman appointee, Steve Marshall the heck out of office. No Ripp report this week. The polls open May 24th and we will be campaigning around the State this weekend. One thing's for sure, no one in their right mind would brave the meth-heads that have descended on Gulf Shores this weekend for Hangout Fest. Proof that Gulf Shores Mayor Robert Craft really doesn't care about his citizenry. Andrew Donald graduated Summa cum laude from BCHS yesterday and is headed to Auburn (with a decent scholarship) to carry on with the family tradition. Congratulations to the great individuals that make up the Baldwin County High School Class of 2022, from a member of the Class of 1992. I would put our Top 10 students each year up against any school's Top 10 in this Country.
