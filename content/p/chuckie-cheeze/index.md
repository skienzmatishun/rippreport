April fools joke? No sadly this is how journalism is portrayed in Baldwin County. We have no print media coverage on the eastern shore, only bad tabloid news. Baldwin County has had some very good journalist, Connie Baggett and Mike Odom were two of the best. What we have been left with is more than embarrassing, it is a travesty of free speech and journalism.

The Gulf Coast tabloid, The Courier, has deteriorated into a tool for Catalyst, a political cancer. The editor has bitten the Catalyst apple and has berated and embarrassed Fairhope as a community. Fairhope should ask themselves, who in the Fairhope Public Library thought that Chuckee should be the one to address Freedom of Speech. Who in the Fairhope library has a Catalyst agenda and thought that Chuckee attacking the Mayor and Fairhope was a good idea?

Chuckee is a journalist, the Ripp Report is a blog site, let that sink in.

> “Independence of spirit and mind, rather than neutrality, is the **principle journalists** must keep in focus. While editorialists and commentators are not neutral, the source of their credibility is still their accuracy, intellectual fairness and ability to inform, not their devotion to a certain group or outcome.”

Chuckee has failed to uphold the basic principle of Journalism by aligning himself with a “dark money” political group like Catalyst. Chuckee has slaughtered the five core principles of journalism and turned a historic paper founded in Fairhope, into toilet paper. The Fairhope Courier. Founded in 1894 by E. B. Gaston, The Fairhope Courier Newspaper came to Alabama and brought with it The Fairhope Single Tax Colony. Chuckee has destroyed that legacy.

**Five Core Principles of Journalism**

- Truth and Accuracy. Journalists cannot always guarantee 'truth', but getting the facts right is the cardinal principle of journalism. ...
- Independence. ...
- Fairness and Impartiality. ...
- Humanity. ...
- Accountability.

Judging the writings of Chuckee in the Courier, it does lead one to believe he is also the editor of Baldwin Insider, a Catalyst blog site.

If you go tonight to listen to Chuckee bring your own popcorn you are going to need something to settle your stomach and consider asking him some questions.

Chuckee: ?

Are you writing for Baldwin Insider?

Have you been recently served with a subpoena?

How many, and when, were you legally warned to cease and assist involving your scribbling ?

Why do you focus so much negative attention on the Mayor and omit any criticism of the Council?

Why do you not use, like other Journalist do, FOIA ,request for documents, from Fairhope?

Who is leaking and providing you with those documents?

Why have you not covered The Fairhope Airport scandal involving Fairhope Council President Jack Burrell?

Why have you not covered Kevin Boone and his many LLC’s ?

Why have you not cover councilman Brown and his unethical behavior in securing a contract with Eastern Shore Art Museum?

Why did you not cover the Tatumville debacle?

Why have you not gone into great detail about Catalyst and their ability to seed mid term elections with candidates that believe in the good ole boys and their entitled right to be corrupt?

Why have you ignored the Majority of citizens and represented the Minority?

Why did you sit on your ass and witness the Fairhope City Council President Jack Burrell deny a citizen the right to free speech? This should have aroused ever fiber in your body, you as a “journalist” should have been outraged. Instead you spin it far from any journalist principals because your alliance is with Catalyst.

Chuckee as far as journalism goes you are a disgrace, however you have your Catalyst followers. It is up to the citizens to disseminate your writings and my bet is they will see you as Chuckee Cheese.
