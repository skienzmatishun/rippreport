 When you have developers in charge of the government we will not have smart growth.   Developers build houses and stress the infrastructure until it collapses then leave us paying more taxes to fix the schools, roads, sewers, and environment.
The developers then take their ill-gotten money and move to another place to mess up.   
The people of Baldwin should be ashamed that they allowed this to happen
