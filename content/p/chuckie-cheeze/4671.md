 I use to read the Courier - not anymore.  The readership of this "newspaper" has fallen to the point of becoming irrelevant.  I will NOT read the Courier nor any of he GCN tabloids.  They are so biased.
As a matter of fact, the GCN actually gives out the paper for free to many organizations just so they can keep their distribution numbers up.  I would name two but it would identify me and I would become a target for the "Dark Money" group.   But hey, most of us know all this about the GCN group.
