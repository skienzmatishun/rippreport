 Wasn't Robert Brown part of the City Council that reprimanded our Mayor for attending a meeting for Fresh Start Fairhope?  I thought I read that Kevin Boone filed an ethics complaint against Mayor Wilson because she was 'attempting to influence voters'.  Even before Boone's complaint, I read on Robert Brown's fb page that he was against the City Manager government because Fairhope didn't need it (because he was doing such a bang-up job?).  I think that the 3 B's may be panicking by having Burrell's Blog (Gulf Coast News Today, LOL) interview Brown as to his opposition to the new government.  Brown is (by miles) the least offensive and pompous of the Bees, but shouldn't Kevin Boone be filing charges against Brown for being blatantly biased?  Such a strange city.....the only rules/laws are amended daily by the City Council to suit themselves.  No wonder Baldwin County is nationally recognized as the most corrupt county in the most corrupt state........can't make that stuff up.  It is obvious that Jay Robinson &amp; Jimmy Conyers are embarrassed by their brethren on the Council and I wish that Brown would go over to the 'light side'.   It would be amazing if the Council cared a flip about Fairhope, wouldn't it?
