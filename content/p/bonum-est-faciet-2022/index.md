Good Riddance 2022. The Baldwin County Legislative Delegation is renting office space to accommodate their growing family. The Mayor of Bay Minette Robert A Bob Wills just so happens to have an available building. The County is required to provide space for the Delegation for their local office and in fact own many offices in Bay Minette at this time, Mr. Ripp has issues with this transaction. No one at the County or State Level "GIVES A DAMN". We break down the players and perps related to the NPR Expose exposing that the Yellow Hammer News, Alabama Political Reporter, ECT, are all part of the Matrix LLC Network and it is indeed, fake news in some cases (which calls your entire credibility into question). Some of them are on your talk radio every day. And guess who their guests are? Pitman, Elliott, Mack. After numerous complaints and a lawsuit, AG Steve Marshall woke from his cryo-sleep and has joined the Mable Amos Trust lawsuit stating " The State of Alabama has an interest in the case". Tom Albritton the Executive Director of the Alabama Ethics Commission and is also a Trustee of the Amos Trust where he is accused of self dealing. He also indicted former Jefferson County Constable Johnathan Barbee of several felonies even though we are aware that he was just cleared by a 3-Judge Special Ethics Panel. And finally we tell you about the murder of Blount County Circuit Judge Steven King, or of his reputation rather.
