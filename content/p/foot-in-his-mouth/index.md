Chris Elliott is a professional politician who has been the Baldwin County Sheriff’s legislature puppet from the day he was elected. First for Hoss Mack, now Anthony Lowery. Elliott’s wife conveniently works for the sheriff department securing that job via Chris Elliott. He maintains there is no conflict of interest.

Elliott constantly bypasses the Baldwin County Legislature body on many issues presenting legislative bills without any review and in some cases no notice to the legislative delegation. He avoided DUI charges playing the system and he has been lying and playing the system ever since.

{{< socialpreview url="https://rippreport.com/p/end-the-good-ole-boy-culture-in-baldwin-county/" >}}

Elliott was elected under the good ole boy culture of Baldwin County. In fact he helped to establish it and has supported that culture since first elected.

Elliott passed a slick piece of legislation that went largely unnoticed and was a blessing to developers.

Senator Chris Elliott has proposed legislation aimed at restricting municipalities from extending their police and planning jurisdictions beyond their corporate limits, addressing concerns about representation and taxation.

It passed while constitutions were asleep and developers cheered.

Currently he is running for re-election and has already made false statements about all the Mayors in Baldwin County endorsing him. He jumped on mud-dumping in the bay after Lagniappe, Al.com, Grandmothers Podcasts and Bay keepers have been covering it for over a year, He has no shame and is so low he could walk under a dime.

In typical Elliott fashion he has his foot in his mouth, AGAIN. This article proves my point about his lying and having no shame.

{{< socialpreview url="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/crime/after-councilman-was-stomped-on-sidewalk-alabama-bill-would-make-assaulting-politicians-a-felony/ar-AA1UhQly" >}}

The title of the article supports libel and character assassination as well as the content.

Please consider Mr Still is over 6 feet tall and weighs close to 300 pounds if he stomped on Councilman Matt Franklin he would look like a pancake. Mr Franklin testified to no injuries related to being stomped on. Franklin also testified, several times, to yelling he was going to Kill Harry and his dog. Mr. Still subdued him, he did not stomp on him. Franklin should be thrown off the City Council of Bay Minette for threatening to kill a person in view of the public and admitting to doing so. He also threatened to kill the dog, what does that tell ya?

In the article Elliott says “law enforcement officials approached him in support of the legislation, citing concerns for people whose jobs make them more vulnerable to physical assault. “ This is typical Elliott B.S. Why does he not identify law enforcement he sure had inside contacts!

The Senate Judiciary Committee does not support him.

“Several lawmakers raised concerns about expanding the number of protected professions, particularly when it comes to elected officials.”

The bill advanced out of the Alabama Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, but not without debate.

STAND BY FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS
