 Well what do you think insurance is for?  Do what you want while "serving" in government and if you get sued then just have the ole insurance policy bail you out.

See, it is like this: Do what you want, get sued, file a claim, repeat.  Repeat until you make enough money and retire.  Soon somebody will name a building after you.
