 Where is the public outrage?!!
Is there something in our water that makes so many so passive?
Why aren't there crowds in the streets with torches and pitchforks demanding an explanation from the city council as to how the airport land deal is in Fairhope''s best interests?
We have a whole lot of smart, well educated and business savvy folks living in Fairhope. Aren't any of them just a bit concerned that if this land deal looks  and smells fishy, it could be rotten. 
(Of course I'm just writing in response to a serious effort to expose suspicious activities, hardly in the vanguard. 
Hey could I have another glass of that Fairhope sweet tea?)
