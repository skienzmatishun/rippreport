 You got to be kidding me for 16 years Fairhope has been a hub of corruption. The Airport Authority is out of control, infrastructure is failing and councilmen Boone and Burrell both have conflict of interest and complaints filed and you worried about cigarettes? Well keep smelling the flowers, That was Kelly you saw Karen twin sister.I hope your son is offended as much by corruption as cigarettes.
