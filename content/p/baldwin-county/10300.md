 Is anyone at all going to blog, post, type out or whatever you would like to call it.....how about what happens to our Country 19 years ago. Friday was the anniversary of 9/11 and I don’t see one single mention of it whatsoever. Maybe I misread, I’m sorry if I have. Ripp, take a minute to please pay at least a small comment on what a terrible day that was, how we witnessed countless acts of heroism and how we all came together to put this country back together for the good of mankind....no matter why or  how many people are trying to tear this country apart. Let’s be thankful and respectful especially for those who lost their live on 9/11/2001!  Thank you
