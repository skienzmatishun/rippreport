 You seem to be in the know about Baldwin County politics. Please go ahead and start a blog and report in-depth news.  I am not trying to be sarcastic.  I am asking for some more news sources.
The Mobile Prejudice Register and Gulf Coast Snooze are not reporting anything of substance.  We have to get what little news we get from Lagniappe and Ripp.
Now if you want to know what is on sale at Winn Dixie then the Mobile Prejudice Register is your go-to source.  Ground beef half off - now that is REAL news! Yippee!!!
