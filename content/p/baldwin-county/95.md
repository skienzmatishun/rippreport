 Tip the Rippster: Paul hope you are well. Just wanted to let you know that judge Floyd is retiring in about a month and a half. He has stepped down as presiding judge. Carmen Bosch is the new presiding circuit judge. After reading your latest report just thought I would let you in on what is going on.
