 On June 28th  i received an email from my ex husband it was a final order awarding him sole custody of our 2 boys and me zero parenting rights and no visitation at all. His attorney Brackin used me moving and not yet changing address to schedule the next hearing to which i didn't know about court at all never received any kind of letter letting me know. Judge was well aware of our custody fight going on since 2013 and I've never missed a date . Since I didn't come to court he racked up its like he won lottery she took all my rights away and no visitation me pay insurance pay child support and pay his 5000 lawyer fees . This is truly devastating to my. Me and my kids . My 14 yr old wrote alerted to judge Thompson asking to speck to her in chambers so his dad lawyer didn't hear any of what he said and tell his father. Well judge told lawyer about letter and did not speck to my son . When my son got back to his dad's he grounded him. What do I do to get this changed i have no lawyer at this time due to finance. How long do I have to appeal?
