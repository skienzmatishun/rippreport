 The title of your post is Baldwin County. Yet, the entire post is about Fairhope until the end. Is it the whole county you have a problem with or just one city?  What about the Daphne runoff?  What about the Spanish Fort runoff?  Even Magnolia Springs where there was no election because everyone was unopposed?  They are all in Baldwin County.  Commentary?
