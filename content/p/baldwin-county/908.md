 My experience has been that Michelle Thomason consistently harms the children, despite the few commentators here blaming the parents.  Many of her decisions bypass rationality.  She consistently wait months and years to make a decision as she is intent on never having her ruling overturned by upper courts.  Thus, the need to drag divorce judgements out until both parties are financially drained.  An appeal costs 40,000 to hundreds of thousands. If you have no money, you cannot appeal.  
    One couple has been waiting nine years, hearing after hearing, to just have this judge grant the divorce. And the entire time, the parent with the children receives no child support from the other parent because Thomason won't rule.   It is not complicated...this judge has a real problem...cannot put it any other way.  
    And concerning politics...she is president of the eastern shore women's republican group...definitely should not be doing this when she is judge.
