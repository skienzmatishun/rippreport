 When the voters of Baldwin ever wake up from the fairy tale they keep telling themselves then maybe the voters will see.  Right now so many of the residents have just moved in from Mobile or other big areas and they are so happy just to be here.  It is like they are in the Matrix and keep taking the blue pills.
If they ever wake up and see that their state delegation is voting in new taxes so that Baldwin is carrying the rest of the state,  the local governments are owned by outside builders making big bucks to throw up cheap houses and then raising property taxes to pay for the overcrowded roads.  Pretty soon the voters will be further taxed to upgrade the sewers because just paying spillage fines will get too frequent.
When this happens people will eventually wake up and see that this unsustainable pillaging has collapsed what was once our home.  Then those responsible for the irresponsible growth will go somewhere else to ruin, just like the locusts they are.
