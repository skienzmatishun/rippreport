 Alabama -Baldwin County (Foley) Satellite Courthouse Judge Thomason has decreed not only that a young mother must take her children on a one hour drive to visit with the man who molested them, but that SHE will spend five days in jail if she refuses!  To make matters even more chilling, when the children begged and cried not to go into the same room with him, she was fined $5.00 for every minute they were not in the room!  Visitation was ordered to be held in Mobile at a place called The Exchange Club, where the little girls must spend two hours with their biological father, who molested both during overnight stays at his home, as documened by an examinig physician and Alabama's DHR Department in signed documents, but this man has not spent a minute in jail and now has been given parental visitation rights!
