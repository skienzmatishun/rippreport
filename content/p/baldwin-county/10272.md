 I'm a relatively new resident of Alabama.  I am flummoxed to see members of my city council serving as boardmembers on city boards supervised by the city council.  Is this LEGAL in Alabama?  (Notice I didn't ask if it is ethical!  I've discovered the word "ethical" should not appear in any sentence containing any form a word(s) related to  Alabama government.)
