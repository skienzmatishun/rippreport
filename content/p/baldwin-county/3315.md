 Hearsay:  Thomasons mantra is to never have a case overturned in appeals.  

Facts:  She often waits years to render decisions in child custody hearings, thus everyone runs dry of money, and they have nothing left for the 40,000-150,000 dollars appeal process.  
She allows attorneys to lie without consequence and will not allow testimony that would run contrary to decisions she renders. 

Personal Opinion based on experience:  Her courtroom is a pitiful place.  I wish more press would cover the courtroom.  Words cannot truly describe the dysfunction that exists there.  I wish everyone affected by her would complain on this anonymous forum.
No doubt she will win this election to the court of appeals...I just hope that the person who takes her place in family court is not as destructive.
