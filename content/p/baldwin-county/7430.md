 Of course the council is loyal to Corte.  Corte gives some farm land for a courthouse, a road, and a cancer center and in turn makes the rest of his land much more valuable, takes a huge tax write off, and expects the county and the city to let him do whatever he wants because of his “charity.”
I was at the zoning meeting where he chastised us citizens because people in Atlanta had to wait two or three traffic light cycles to get through an intersection.   Corte thinks we should have to tolerate this because he is greedy and feels he owns the town.
Corte you may own the council until we vote them out but you do not own us.  We don’t owe you anything
