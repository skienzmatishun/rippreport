 I was a victim of this process too.  Steven Johnson was my ex-husbands attorney.  We had a different judge assigned to our case, not Michelle Thomason, until Steven Johnson hired another attorney to be part of my ex-husbans legal team.  This new attorney was a consultant to our judge, so the judge was taken off the case, and the new Judge, Michelle Thomason, was assigned.   Bullies with power!
