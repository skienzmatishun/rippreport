 I know a quite a number of the mentors in the Veteran's court and they have nothing but high praise for Michelle's dedication and passion to helping our local veterans stay out of jail and get their problems turned around.  

I have never appeared in any Baldwin Court, but I have 3 friends who had Michelle as their presiding judge for divorce and their experiences differ greatly from what is described here.  I think there are few jobs more dangerous or more thankless than being a family court judge.  My experience, even with good friends, is that it is usually the parents whose behavior puts their children at risk. We are a community property state and it is the law.  Divorcing parents often go to war, at the expense of their children.
