 Blow the dust off the constitution and start reading it. Any dispute over 20$ is supposed to be heard by a jury of your peers. Demand that all your unalienable rights are intact before you sign or agree to anything. CHALLENGE JURISDICTION! give notice to all involved if they try to take your property or put you in jail without a jury trial that you will kill their ass for committing fraud and criminal acts!!! The tyranical mother fuckers are out of control and need to be shutdown!!!
