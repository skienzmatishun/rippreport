 It is so easy to see what they are doing.  They are making a clandestine path to allow Corte to develop this land.  While we cannot see on the other side of the smoke and mirrors they have set up in the name of a "Conservation Easement," you can bet on the other side of the smoke and mirrors is Corte building more of his patio homes, homes by Truland and DR Horton, more apartments, and a shopping center.
Go ahead and call us conspiracy theorists.  We have seen you guys work like rats in the darkened back rooms so much for so long, we just know you all are up to something that will benefit yourselves at the cost to the citizens.
These guys have been sneaky in what they are pulling off.  If we, the citizens allow this to happen then we deserve this bunch.
Somebody must stop Corte buying the politicians at wholesale prices.
