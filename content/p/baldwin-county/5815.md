 Let's not forget Jon Gray. He is he politico behind BCBE AND Chris Elliott. He lives in Fairhope and is contributing to it's downfall by selling out to the highest bidder. Fairhope is supposedly his home, yet he doesn't care to make our school system better. He also is getting paid to help a snake win office. He is the lowest of them all!
