 I agree with USMC 1967.  Christenberry thinks everything is a joke and shows it with his clowning ways at the Board meetings. The proper management of a school system is serious business, not something to joke about with parental concerns. It is all about covering up lies, intimidation of teachers who speak out, mismanagement of funds and the out of control spending for non essential personnel and programs.
