 Congratulations all you sorryass Alabama politicians for not accomplishing anything about the Lottery Bill and the Abortion Bill that you all screwed up. Besides treating women like dogs and screwing us out of the Lottery and then doing NOTHING the last 2 years and still receiving your salaries and your outrageous expense accounts. Besides you crooks, Monday is going to be harder to celebrate my father's death in the war as he certainly wasted his time for you duds. Come over Monday and Iâ€™ll feed you a shit sandwich. That should hit your tastebuds just fine.
