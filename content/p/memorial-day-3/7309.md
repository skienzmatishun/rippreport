 I spoke to a good friend of mine who happens to be white. Most are in FH. Hear me out. I asked him about Senator Pittman, Elliott's predecessor in the senate. I asked about him stealing the BP contract for boom placement. He said "that didn't happen."
I asked him "What?"
He said, "That was just Paul Ripp spreading lies.  Trip is good. He is free and clear."
As far as I can tell, Trip is not good. Trip is bad.
Trip stole a contract meant for experts in boom placement. He was a tractor salesman.
So I guess Trip got away with it. But the fact that so many think he is
a good guy still is troubling. I think it is related to how they think Elliott actually gives a shit about their families and is a conservative.

Jesus didn't mean for alabama republicans to take his name in vain.

But they do.

Take em' all down Ripp!!!!!! They do the devils work.
