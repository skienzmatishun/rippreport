 You nailed it African American FH.  These guys who moved in here from Georgia and Mississippi came here and sold the locals that they were of God.  Now they are fleecing them.
What’s more, the out-of-control growth they are causing in this area is resulting in gentrification in the south part of Fairhope.
I wonder how the once established old families in that part of town feel to be forced out of their hometown?
Brown doesn’t know beans about what s hometown is until he is forced out of it like those families that had to move due to higher taxes, developers buying the landlords out, and deed technicalities.
But, still, the Catalyst folk are “Men of God.” This is indeed how the Devil works
