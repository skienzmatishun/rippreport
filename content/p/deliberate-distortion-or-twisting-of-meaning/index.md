The Fairhope City Council and Weeks Bay are trying to tell the general public that a Conservation Easement does not mean Weeks Bay owns the property. True they also have no lease or title to the land.

The city is simply “disposing” of the property and any control of the property. The City would be signing over management and control for perpetuity to Weeks Bay. That’s forever baby!

Why would the City of Fairhope “dispose” of prime city property?

{{< socialpreview url="https://rippreport.com/p/three-strikes/" >}}

The Fairhope City Council has been striking out since they were elected. Citizens had better come together and prevent the council from “politically disposing” of 106 acres of City of Fairhope Property.

Shame on Weeks Bay for playing semantics with the future of Fairhope.

Who is the anonymous donor coughing up 39,000 dollars for this good ole boy deal? Why does Weeks Bay and the City Council want to keep it a secret?
