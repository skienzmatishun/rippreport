# Transcript

The host examines legal and judicial issues surrounding marijuana, gun laws, and systemic failures in Alabama and Massachusetts. A 2023 Fifth Circuit ruling upholds that an admitted regular cannabis user cannot be criminally liable under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(3), stating past drug use does not justify disarming a sober citizen. Only 400–800 such cases exist nationally, most tied to drug or arms running, not casual use. Federal prosecutors, including "ice queen" Gloria Bedwell, face criticism for selective enforcement, particularly in Alabama where marijuana remains illegal and medical access is severely restricted. Despite 27 states legalizing medical or recreational use—including CBD—federal law classifies marijuana as Schedule One, and enforcement disproportionately targets law-abiding citizens. A hypothetical case shows that if a man buys CBD, smokes it at McDonald’s, and has a gun, police could search—yet officers cannot distinguish CBD from marijuana without lab testing, making the defense likely to win. In Alabama, a judge must interpret an ambiguous medical marijuana law, and state enforcement blocks access despite public demand. In Massachusetts, the prosecution of Karen Reed—accused of murdering her boyfriend John O’Keefe—is deemed baseless. Evidence shows O’Keefe never entered the home at 34 Fear View Road; phone data and 11 witnesses confirm he didn’t, and no fight occurred. Reed, a Boston police officer, dropped off her boyfriend, who didn’t return; she returned at 5 a.m. to find him bludgeoned in the front yard. The defense proves brake light fragments were planted, and police never entered the suspect’s home. Over 600 protested, highlighting public outrage and systemic failures. The case mirrors Kafka’s *The Trial*, symbolizing authoritarian overreach and unchecked judicial power. In a separate incident, Alabama’s Department of Revenue identified a 1968 Camaro with a stolen VIN—found in a junkyard assembled from multiple cars—and reported it as stolen. Sheriff HosMack’s office obtained a warrant, targeting Jason Hadley at his church, publicly embarrassing him. Hadley, a licensed attorney, filed a civil lawsuit, arguing the car wasn’t stolen as a whole and claiming ownership issues, and obtained a temporary restraining order from Judge Stankowski. He personally texted the deputy, begging not to seize the car. The next day, Hadley’s client drove the Camaro to Baugh County High School, where his mother was present and reportedly threatened with arrest for “interfering with God’s operations.” The sheriff and DA appealed the TRO, claiming procedural violations. Judge Stankowski ruled no contempt but ordered the sheriff to retrieve the car for verification. The case centers on a Camaro with a Ford engine—legally impossible for a Chevrolet—raising procedural and evidentiary concerns. Critics highlight that the sheriff’s office allegedly sold impounded vehicles, and low-priority car theft consumes resources meant for serious crimes like excessive force deaths. The case reflects broader mismanagement and political influence, with former Judge Wilters (now DA) reportedly telling attorneys, “Get me this case—I’ll put Steve Notine under the courthouse,” raising alarm over judicial interference. The host criticizes the lack of due process and the failure to investigate unsolved deaths. Meanwhile, Senator Chris Elliot placed a 45-day hold on the $1.1–1.2 billion West Alabama Corridor project, citing lack of federal funding and state budget concerns, despite US-43 being a federal highway. Lt. Gov. Ainsworth and England also blocked contracts. Separately, Liberty Safe reportedly handed over a master combination to law enforcement without a warrant, raising serious privacy and safety concerns—especially after a fire at a Mobile facility. The host expresses concern that Mike Ward’s sponsorship of radio programs may lead to the company’s collapse due to the controversy.
