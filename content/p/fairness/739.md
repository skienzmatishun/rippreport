 This is so true!!! It's time for the council to start representing and get serious! It's not a joke! 
 Let's see them start working to make a difference in our community instead they are the problem and not the solution! 
 The department that you are a liaison for... Work to make it better... Think outside the box.....
And most importantly show up for meetings! 
Council- Take a look at Daphne city council meetings and maybe you can learn something!
