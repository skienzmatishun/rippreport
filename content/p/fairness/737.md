 In all fairness are we now going to give all the developers ten times to get it right?
I have replayed the video of the last City Council Meeting several times. On a lighter note, Mr. Robinson's attempt at humor is disgusting and a waste of time at these business meetings. We can discuss his pen clicking and his chair sitting lower than everyone else's AFTER the City Council Meeting. On a more serious note, Mr. Robinson talked about being scared of lawsuits ...does this mean he will vote in favor of the developers who threaten lawsuits if it does not go their way?  How fair is that??
Burrell, Boone, Brown and Robinson can do a lot of damage to our city in the next four years!
