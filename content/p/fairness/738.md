 Yes! Yes! 100% correct! Growth IS absolutely inevitable. That is NOT the argument here. Plain and simple, if you want a beautifully planned town, you must fight for it. There is such a thing as smart planned growth. It does not make as much money for the developers. They would much rather stuff high density shitty housing. It's true, that's how you maximize the short profit and move on. You absolutely, 100% have a choice, Fairhope. Are you going to fight? Are you afraid of being called an idiot for doing so? Is that all it takes? We have something special here, don't throw it away on threats of inevitability.
