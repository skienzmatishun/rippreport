 Yes I am a Fairhope Native - lived here 60 plus years - I know how it use to be before the corruption which has been going on for some time.  The new City Council is a joke - you have Burrell who wants to be the boss - very arrogant &amp; downs the Mayor about everything,  Boone  who has met with Burrell before the meetings &amp; rehersed everything they will do in the meetings ahead of time, Brown who we now see is up Burrells &amp; Boone's rear end (very brown nosed), Jay Robinson who is afraid City will get sued so we need to go ahead &amp; approve so will not be sued - guess we can take anything now &amp; get approved!! (If I was guessing - he is an Attorney) - Conyers - not quite sure but I do not think he is swayed as much by the others.   The Council is not listening to the public that elected them - enjoy your last term - actually hope it is not a full term &amp; many can get together to stop these conflict of interest violations.  Burrell - it is not a "privilege" to let the public speak at meetings - it is our right - you are a controlling jerk!!
