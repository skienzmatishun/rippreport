 Respectfully, I think you must have misunderstood the part where he stated they could easily annex into Daphne, Fairhope would still get all the students, the traffic and none of the tax revenue. He also started at that point the city would have no control on any environmental regulations that are so vital to protecting fly creek. I appreciated his insight on the very possiable litigation that could cost Fairhope tax payers millions and we could still end up with development on the property! He is the only one I have heard discussing what possiable outcomes and choices the city has at THIS point responsibly move forward. He has a degree in finance and a law degree and seemed both knowledgeable and reasonable. Being scared and being smart are two very different things. 

Also, I wish there was a little bit more light conversation... those meeting have become such an angry, dark place and that's not reminiscent of our community. Everyone could stand to be a little friendlier in my opinion!
