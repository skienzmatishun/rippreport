Actually I did not misunderstand what Mr. Robinson said.  I feel your vote as a City Councilman should not be determined by whether or not you think a developer will sue the city or not. If that is how you determine your vote then you have just handed our city over to the developers who will threaten the city with lawsuits if they are denied. What do you not understand about that scenario?
I am not impressed that you say he has degrees in finance and law. I find that his reasoning is scary and not smart at all.
