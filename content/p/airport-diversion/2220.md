 I have refueled and rearmed, had some forward arming and refueling points set so I will be on station! Yeah, I am back by popular demand and it is clear Frances (Little Man) has once again tried to deflect away from the truth. Queen Karin the First of Fairhope (QKFF) is at it again, another claim against the city, that award winning personality of her's is gaining accolades for our city.
I said this before and I will say it again, it is time for the Queen to step down. It seems she has this knack to be, well, to say this mildly, to LIE! Little Man is not far behind her with all of his mistruths and deflection from the facts that he posts on what he claims is a 'report'. Little Man likes to make things up and as he goes along. 
Little Man, you are about to wake to the truth and then most, those that have any intelligence will come to see that you are as full of crap that those geese in the bay! Or should I spell it like the Queens spells things, gooses!

Strike Fast! Strike Hard! 

A long long time again,
I can remember how the other mayor's use to make me smile!
