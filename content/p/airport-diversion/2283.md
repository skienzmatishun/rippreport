 When someone files ethic complaint after ethic complaint, the ethic commission becomes deaf even if one may have some merit. When you scream fire every day and the firefighters come running and each time it there is no fire, then there is a real fire, the firefights keep eating their dinner. It is like when Sue tells the teacher, Paul hit me, Paul looked at me, Paul pulled my hair, well Sue, Paul was not at school today. Ohhhh. Well, I thought Paul did it. Two of the commissioners were senior circuit judges and they have heard it all before.
