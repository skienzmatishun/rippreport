 That's very good advice.  Here's some more:  "Where is the proof that no one is under investigation?"  See how that works?  To put it simply, just because we may not know anything yet does not mean that an investigation is not going on.  You think these people who undertake investigations have a responsibility to us to keep us apprised of what they're learning until the indictments come down?
