 "Anyone can file an ethics complaint but it doesn't make it true."  Well, all I want to say about that is that these things take time and just because we don't know more YET does not mean that we won't.  Now, let's look at all the people who immediately took Pandora Heathcoe's charge that the Mayor "assaulted" her as fact.  Just because someone brings a charge against another does not make it true.  Yet people always want to take sides and their side is always right, and the other side is always wrong.  Also - "the people I have spoken with" say this and that is not really a compelling argument.  Every one of us can find people to tell us whatever we want to hear.  "For her to resign tells all of us that something is wrong within the interworking of the city."  OR - maybe she resigned to cover her butt because she knows she's about to get in deep trouble for repeatedly and consistenly leaking information to GCM, who is clearly biased against the Mayor and everything she does.  Certainly you are welcome to your opinions, but your opinions are only that; unfortunately you are cloaking those opinions in a way that tries to bolster your own case, whatever that might be.
