 There are more than 2, I have spoken to 4 different companies that stated they were not doing business with Fairhope because of the new administration actions. They don't want to end up on some message board. One was seriously wanting to relocate to the airport but he felt if something happened then his company would end up being trashed. He was going to employee 20 new employees but relocated to another airport. It is a damn shame that we here in Fairhope are being laughed at because of computer issues. What many do not understand in this area of Alabama, most know each other and many are related. When you cross many of the old timers folks they take it real personally. The next election we need to find a mayoral candidate that has real executive experience, and has a positive message and does not companion on negatives. This all started during the campaign cycle. I wanted to change, just not this type of change. I truly believe that the council is trying to protect the city from more reputational harm. I am not sure who would want to work for this administration, the employees have to trust and if they think they are being taped, followed or whatever then the good people will not apply. Sad day for Fairhope!
