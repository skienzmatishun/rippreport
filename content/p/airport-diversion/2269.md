 These 'under investigation' allegations have been flying around for years.  I have never seen anyone take them seriously (outside of the city limits).  Political corruption is rampant everywhere on earth and Fairhope is certainly no exception.  Not enough of the voters seem to care how twisted and greedy our elected leaders are.  Very sad but very true.
