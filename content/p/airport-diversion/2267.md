 Georgia:  "Donâ€™t think that I wish that Wilson had not won."  It's hard for anyone to believe that statement when you constantly post negative things about the Mayor.  And:  " Mrs. Smith is a professional and I doubt that she would leak any information to anyone. " Honestly, that's just ridiculous.  Are you honestly saying that a "professional" would have no reason to leak information to anyone?  That's LUDICROUS.  She has friends who run Gulf Coast Media.  They LOVE it when she leaks info to them that they can jump on immediately.  This is what they do!  For all we know they are PAYING her for leaked information.  You really are naive.
