 So much for Jester Triple Six's word on no more posting. Another traitor from the military that slipped through the cracks. It's certainly a far cry saying that you are back by popular demand. If you are all the things you said you were after I wrote Sunday. "I'm on the way to Church, Let's all stop this crap" well I certainly have not posted anything at all. But Jester, A Man is only good as his word and your word means nothing. I too was a pilot in the military and certainly would not want you as my wing man. You are a disgrace to the community, your entire family and to the men and women who serve or have served our country.   Way to go Jester. You have no right to brag on your military service. I knew you wouldn't shut up. Liars and the very weak minded never do. They can't help it!  It's an illness. You don't know the true meaning of Patriotism!  But some of us actually do! I encourage those of you who are true men and women to keep avoiding making any comments on the many worthless posts made by the Jester. He has proven that he is a liar and a traitor. I sincerely feel sorry for him.
