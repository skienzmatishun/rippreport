 Speak for yourself, there are many that believe Jester just calls it like it is. I am sure Jester is a narcissist, but so is the Mayor, Ripp, Dean, most on the Council and a lot of others too. All leaders are narcissistic that is what makes leaders good leaders. Who is the Jester anyway, did anyone figure out is Jester is a man or woman? He/she has turned this site up side down as of late. There was a time when Ripp focused on ANYONE that was doing wrong, but it seems all he does now is support the mayor even when she is wrong. Sorry.
