 It is my understanding that council has the right to view anything within the government. If they ask for something they are allowed to view a document because they are responsible for all the financial matters within the city. My dealings with Ms. Smith has always been professional, she is one of the most professionals within the CPA industry. Her resigning is problematic, for her to resign tells all of us that something is wrong within the interworking of the city. From what I hear the ethics commission found no wrong doing and that came from an attorney I know in Montgomery. The people I have spoken with indicated that Ripp has asked others to investigate but those investigations are going nowhere. Anyone can file an ethics complaint but it doesn't make it true. Anyone can call the FBI and tell them of wrongdoing but that doesn't mean they are going to investigate, they do have an obligation to listen. All of the issues of the computers and tracking software is troubling, very troubling. The only good news about Ms. Smith's resignation, she is not suing the mayor or city for wrongful discharge. All of this is so sad for the city, there are two companies that have told me directly they are not interested in doing business with Fairhope.
