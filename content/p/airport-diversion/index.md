Jack, come fly with me, has more passengers. _The Courier_, editor “Chucky Cheese” is working hard for free flights. He has signed on with the pilot, "come fly with me” Jack to cover the most mundane of articles that amounts to cut and paste. The local AM station, it is hard to find, has also signed on to allow Jack all the time he needs to talk about anything but the airport.

Councilman Brown in his letter states that:

## HATE

“The Ethics complaint against Council President Jack Burrell and Airport board member, Mr. Ray Hix, have both been 'ruled baseless.'" This is yet another attempt to quash the FACT that both men ARE under investigation, which is on going. Chucky and the am lady never ask jack about his free flights, ethics complaint or his role in securing the airport bid for board member Hix.

The latest attempt to get the plane off the ground was _the Courier_ article about invoices and letters regarding computer work the City of Fairhope contracted. The sad thing about their persistent articles and commentary is that their limited, yet important audience, is getting a slanted view of reality while ignoring serious issues.

In the statement by Elias Technologies, they discuss the scope of work to be preformed, specifically.

Chucky is very clever with his quotation marks but one comment stands out. Much like Mr. browns statement, Chucky closed the statement by Elias by say: “No evidence of mishandled information was ever identified.” Who made that statement? It certainly was not Elias as their scope of work did not cover them making a determination if information was mishandled. Chucky who told you to add that sentence?

Chucky also gives the former mayor press coverage and allows him to weigh in on the non issue. This is quite telling as the former mayor is warming up to run for another elected office and anything he contributes to the subject, is self serving. The Ripp Report looks forward to the former mayor's attempt to get re-elected to public office.

It is also quite telling that the invoices and letters are addressed to Deborah Smith, City of Fairhope. She has turned in her resignation to the city. It is suspected, by me, that she was giving documents to Jack and he is forwarding the information to Chucky. Why resign? Maybe she sees the writing on the wall and that this is all going to go to court and she decided to give her plane tickets back to Jack.

It is a no news story and the Mayor explained her position:

AIRPORT DIVERSION Ask yourself why would Mr. Burrell press for an investigation into invoices that were, mutually amended, that saved the city thousands of dollars? Simple answer, to try and get the heat off his ass about the pending ethics investigation. Why doesn’t chucky and the am lady cover the issues that have cost Fairhope millions?

CHUCKY WHAT CHEESE YOU PRINT!
