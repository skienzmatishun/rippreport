 I have contact the Vetetans Administration and showed them some snap shots of Jester and his comments and his wingman bullshit. Well. They have agreed, if Jester is not under their care already to help this person out. He has problems and I would like to help him. A veteran contacted me regarding Jester. The guy definitely needs help. Let us help Jester. Make your failures in life stop eating at you. Stop the harassing of civilians and the far from being well cry outs! Please let us help you. If you have already been to the Biloxi, Pensacola or Mobile VA. We might can figure who you are and help. Either way. Help is available at no charge to you.  We don't want to see you continue to hurt yourself. Let's get you better.
