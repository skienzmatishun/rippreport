 You never flew close air support Anonymous, you must have been one of those that hauled crap from one base to other or flew for the coast guard. If you flew close air support then you would know how to get down and dirty to attack those that are attacking the good guys! 
What makes you think you'd have the privilege of being my wingman? You wouldn't be allowed to become a pimple on Little Man's butt. You want all the crap to stop, then Little Man has to stop his lies. The Queen is destroying this city, you know this, we all know this, she is lying, Little Man is spinning the truth, and you are right on one issue, a man is only good as his word and Little Man is going to owe me $5,000 for showing he publishes FALSE 'reports'. 
Now, if you actually believe that your 'reverse psychology' is going to work, maybe in feeble mind and other people like yourself it could work but not on Jester! 
You are one of the biggest fools of all the fools on here, "please, oh please, Jester, please go away" when the lies stop the Jester will stop. 
AND feeling sorry for me, that and $3.50 will get me a cup of coffee at the bookstore! 
If you want to make Fairhope Great, then ask the mayor to resign and then the city can move forward.
I bet your call sign was 'fool'!
