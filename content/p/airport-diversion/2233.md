 Jest-A-Narcissit, your ego would not allow you to stop flapping your gums, or is it wings, as you seem very accomplished? Why don't you list your engagements with hostiles and we can compare them to that of Mr. Francis Ripp and see who actually served their country. Flying sortie's over Grenada is not the same as being knee deep in the s#&amp;t in Vietnam. That is if you were actually out there operating instead of in the rear with the gear.
