 Yes, unfortunately folks like Jester love the sound of their own words so much they can't shut up.  But honestly, I am surprised he's back while using his own name.  I thought for sure he'd recreate himself with another handle.  But I guess he's simply too attached to who he imagines some people still believe he is and that there might be some truth to the things that he says.
