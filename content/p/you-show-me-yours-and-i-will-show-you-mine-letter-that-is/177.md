 How can our airport make money if everyone is allowed to put their own fuel tanks on their hangar space? They should have to buy the gas from continental. 
Why wouldn't the airport authority build a hangar and lease the space out themselves! You don't need an aviation background to know how to make a good business deal. 
Who's going to monitor that cedar creek ( Boan) and Fairhope judge ( Sneddeker)&amp; treasurer of airport authority ( Hix) hangars are truly for personal use? That could be problematic alone since one has deals in oil, energy and sewer pipelines . The other has businesses all over the United States. 
Doesn't take a NASA engineer to do this research! 
Why would we have an airport authority board member treasurer not even attend meetings?( Burrell said). Last but not least ... Should the citizens be concerned that bids were tabulated at Bucks Diner...
Why were there even bids if it's for personal use? 
If these people are using it for private use why wouldn't you let all three "bids" build a hangar space.
City council &amp; airport authority board- we the citizens of Fairhope are not DUMB!!
If there's nothing to hide why get so worked up? 
Drain the swamp!! It smells like SEWER to me!
