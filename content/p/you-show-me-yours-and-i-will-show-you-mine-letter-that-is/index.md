The Ripp Report and Baldwin County Legal Eagle is a nonprofit. We are a consumer group and take no donations from political candidates or organizations that wish to use our platform. The Ripp Report files legitimate complaints with the agency that may handle that case. Currently complaints reside with Attorney General, Ethics Commission, Judiciary, and Bar Association. These complaints originate from consumers contacting us. We endorse candidates and encourage public participation in exposing political and Judicial Corruption in Baldwin County. YOU are the Court of Public Opinion.

SENATOR PITTMAN HAS TO HAVE THE FULL COOPERATION OF MAYOR KANT TO BID AND RECEIVE MUNICIPLE CONTRACTS WITH FAIRHOPE.

WITHOUT KANT AND THE COUNCIL APPROVAL SENATOR PITTMAN WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SECURE CONTRACTS.

**YOU SHOW ME YOURS AND I WILL SHOW YOU MINE — Letter that is.**

Kant and Pittman claim they have a letter from the Ethics commission that EXONERATES them from any wrong doing involving Fairhope BP Boom Grant. Please Mayor please bring that letter to the forum Thursday night.

_They do not have such a letter._

In public they just blow it off saying that the Ethics commission found nothing wrong. The Ethics commission "closed the file" they did not investigate it, the FBI did, which resulted in a Grand Jury. The current position that I was informed of by the Alabama Attorney’s Office, is that the case was forwarded to Special Prosecutor Matt Hart, of the white collar division of the Attorney General’s office where it resides today. Two identical complaints were filed; one is the latter the other was filed with the BP Fraud Division.

That complaint was investigated and I was told they also cooperated with the Alabama Attorney General, which is protocol. Please do not escape the fact that the good senator did not have a general contractor’s license at the time.  Which was mandatory? Mayor Kant and Sen. Pittman also authorized an untold number of anchors and rope to be left in the bay by simply cutting them free from the boom. The contract called for retrieval.

This new complaint involves his contract with the city of Fairhope for emergency debris removal, such as hurricanes. It is a clear conflict of interest and shows a lack of ethics and common sense on the part of the Mayor and City Council, for doing business with an elected official. The Mayor and Senator have waived a letter from the Ethics commission "claiming" it was all right for the good senator to do personal company business with Fairhope. Semantics, what the letter really says is the good Senator may proceed however he must stay within the Ethics Rules. Personal Gain is key to the complaint.

What message are we sending our kids?

Is it, _run for public office and you can enrich yourself by using your elected position_?

The complaint will also reveal the "bidding” procedure the city used to insure Senator Pittman remained the Contractor. The Ethics commission has agreed to look at the complaint and they will have the final word.

I have shown you my letter _so ask the Mayor or Senator Pittman where their letter is_.

Performing Arts Center

The Mayor paid Alabama Media Group for a "sponsored content" Article.

[A PERFORMING ARTS CENTER TO INSPIRE THE FUTURE OF FAIRHOPE](http://blog.al.com/sponsored/2016/08/a_performing_arts_center_to_in.html), August 9th. They had two embedded links to the Mayor.  The content was totally fabricated by the Mayor and was not fact checked by the Alabama Media Group, who failed three times to return calls, from the Ripp Report.

The Mayor is the reason we do not have a Performing Arts center. No fact checking at all while the Mayor continues to lie to his constituents.

The truth is Fairhope does not have a Performing arts center because of the Mayor.

In the mid 90’s the Dyas family offered the land for FREE in the triangle for a Performing Arts Center. The first estimated costs were 4 million, 2 million less than our soccer complex. Around 2005 the subject came up again, and again — the Dyas family offered the land for a Performing Arts Center. The Dyas family also pledged free land for a fire station. Mayor Kant rejected all offers except Mr. Cortes, who needed the fire station next to his proposed apartments on a dead end street.
