 Paul Ripp is a Vietnam veteran and a personal hero of mine. His father was one of the most
courageous consumer advocates in Alabama history who returned millions of dollars to the
people through his efforts, so Paul comes by his honesty and integrity by learning from the best.
Please notice that the cowardly boobs who insult Paul do not identify themselves nor will they.
I believe this story has deep and dark secrets that will show up as it progresses. Keep up the great
work Paul.
