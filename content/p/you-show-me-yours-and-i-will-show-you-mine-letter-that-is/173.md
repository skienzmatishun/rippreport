 I've tried to look objectively at the Ripp Report and take what I can from it. But it seems to be borne of a recipe of open ended questions, innuendo, and suggestions at wrong doing, not proof or wrong doing, which is what this article communicates to me. In the meantime it slanders people by questioning their motives, which concerns me. Not everyone doing business in Fairhope is crooked, but it's a small town and you're surely going to brush up against people who definitively are crooked. I want legitimate business people to feel secure enough to take risks and make investments in our town without having to fear ending up on a tabloid, which this oftentimes feels like. Please, more facts. Less wink wink nudge nudge.
