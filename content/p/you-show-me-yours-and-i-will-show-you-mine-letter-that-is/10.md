 I would suggest that anyone who is unhappy with Fairhope - the way it exists today - please move somewhere else.  It's a simple suggestion.  We're rated as the top place to raise kids, the top place to retire and the fastest growing population.  If you're not happy with the way it is - and the way it got that way - then please find another place to hang your hat.  Bye.
