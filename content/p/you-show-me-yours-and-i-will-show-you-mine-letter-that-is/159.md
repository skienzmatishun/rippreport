 Folks,
Some questions and comments.
I would appreciate if you would expand on the criteria for selection.  The article stated that the criteria were presented and there was an open question and answer period.  
Next, if there was some objection to the final decision, did the other two bidders file an appeal of some type.  
Finally, please, can you provide evidence that the "Best Choice" wasn't made?  I think it would be hard to prove tampering if the best choice for the city was made.  
Thanks in advance for clarification.
