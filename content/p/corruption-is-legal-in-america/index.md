How do you clean up corruption? Legislatively, or simply vote them out. However one common denominator is the citizens themselves. When elections results show only 17% of the voters are exercising their right to vote, then it is a good indicator political corruption is flourishing.

I had no idea how bad things actually were until I saw one simple graph.

Many times people come up with the problem but no solutions, here is a solution:

These new anti-corruption efforts are sweeping the county on the state and municipal level. The 14 municipalities in Baldwin County as well as the county commission would go a long way with public trust and eliminating corruption with the adoption of such an anti-corruption act. The Ripp Report will promote this effort on a county and state level.

Incidents like the Fairhope Airport Authority scandal, soccer fields, lawsuits, fly creek apartments and the sewer plant contract would be much more transparent and hold elected officials accountable. Depending on the Alabama Ethics Commission has proven fruitless. Citizens need to start at the ground level and hold elected officials to our own municipal anti-corruption standards and vote out the bad apples.
