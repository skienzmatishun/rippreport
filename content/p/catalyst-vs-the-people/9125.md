 Ripp actually created Burrell, instrumental in getting him elected via his personal clean sweep campaign because he wasn't pleased with mayor kant or the council at the time, especially Debbie Quinn. He went after all of them and helped put this gang of 5 in charge. He tries but won't listen to anyone on probable ramifications of his actions. He won't listen to anything he doesn't want to hear, politically speaking. He is starstruck with Karin, whom he helped finally replace Kant and worships the quicksand she and her top advisor Mosher walk on. He won't get it thru his thick well meaning head and heart he is simply being used by both of them because he has to have something to believe in. Ripp is a decent guy outside of the politics. Does a great deal for many groups especially vets..himself being Vietnam vet.
