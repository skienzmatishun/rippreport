 Georgia, keep your fu$&amp;ing dogs at home along with your petty golf carts. Dammit, I like to live amongst a city where I could enjoy the company of nice friendly people and not worry about all the bitching and moaning about ones dog or golf cart or just how much money one has while. Oh well, there same people among with their friends who they have convinced to move here from all over the country now want to basically tell us to kiss their asses and they want to run things their way!! I call BS!
