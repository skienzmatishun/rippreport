 The BP guy on a paddle board tried to get an ordinance passed for dogs to be allowed in restaurants. Even the worst council in Fairhope history refused to get on his paddle board for that. People are dying in Baldwin County, others have major health issues,TODAY, from BP chemicals and oil. BP ignored the fraud and threw money at everyone, as a solution. The BP paddle board guy has blown these issues aside. What about the hundreds of anchors and thousands of feet of chain cable and rope used to secure boom, that Pittman and Cant just cut free to remain in  the bay.If you were in this area during the oil spill and experienced the financial and emotional hit Baldwin County and its citizens experienced, then you would NEVER vote for a BP guy with a paddle board.
