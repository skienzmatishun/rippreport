 Now that Sherry has thrown her hat in, the truth will come out. It will be shocking if she can walk away from this after the embarrassment. I used to work for her.  She is a bully and takes credit for everyone's ideas. 

She also worked for catalyst before, during last election and  after Mayor Wilson took office!  There was no chance the City would have accomplished what it has with her insubordinate ass still in place. 

The choice is clear - elect Wilson as a proven leader or Sullivan as a proven politician for special interests.
