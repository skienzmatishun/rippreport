 Just speaking  up at a council meeting does nothing.   You have to spread the word and base what you say on facts.  You have to vote against Catalyst.   Kant in Dairhope was a general and he was taken out by the people.  It can be done but these guys bet that the masses don’t know or don’t care. Their bets have been all correct in the past but as people find out they are realizing what is happening.  
We in Daphne have to stay on guard because the vote on destroying Olde Town can come back up anytime by Scott on the council here
