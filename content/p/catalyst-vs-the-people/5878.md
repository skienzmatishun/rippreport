 If you are talking about WACO AM Radio then you are correct. The swap shop show is lame and not many people call and the announcers have to talk fillers to keep from getting dead air.   This station was once owned by a member of the Fairhope Planning Committee that is owned by Corte.
This station plays  “Moldy Oldies” where Mac Davis, Petula Clark, and Niel Diamond are on the playlist.   Really?  What is the pattern of that playlist?  Oh yeah, that is what Moldy Oldies is all about:  songs that were forgotten for good reasons
