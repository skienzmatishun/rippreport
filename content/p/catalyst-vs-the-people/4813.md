 All you Catalyst people can do to respond to this is call it @subversion” and “lies.”   What part of this post are lies?   Is it a fact that these guys are handled by Catskyst?   Is it s fact that these candidates take money from outside real estate companies?  Is it a fact that  Catalyst was founded by people who know hold office?   
So what part of this are lies?
By the way the way just because somebody disagrees with you doesn’t make it subversion.  “Subversion” is a word dictators use when their power is questioned
