 How does the council convince all the new people who moved in to vote against themselves and allow cat list to build more?

This is logic defying. 

Cat list appears dumber than a box of rocks.  Too much traffic. Trailers in schools. No more jubilees. Nobody likes this council. They will build to fill their pockets and talk with marbles in their mouth about being christian. 

Fairhope is wise now thanks to Mister Ripp.

God help these council "mice."
