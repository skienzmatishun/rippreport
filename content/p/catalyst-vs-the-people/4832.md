 BorninFH, are you scared, frightened or even intimidated by Pau Ripp. You sound like a punk who is a very unhappy person. I actually feel sorry for you that you have to direct so much negativity towards Paul Ripp. What are you scared of. We all have the right to speak up about the problems that are going on in Fairhope. Get the heck out of here. I know what a coward you are. You wouldnâ€™t dare say that to Paul while he he was standing in front of you. You are really pathetic. Bastard child would be my guess.
