 Hey Marlow,  We just got in from a soccer tournament from the “new” soccer field. I couldn’t find a parking space and when someone opens the bathroom door to the Men’s bathroom you can see the whole row of urinals on both sides of the bathroom.  Not one score board up and places where the handicap would become even worse off than they are. To watch a game on 8 different fields and not know how much time is left, what period or even what the score is, was disheartening. No threat from me, but the likes of you that had any planning, construction or the incompleteness of the complex shouldn’t be cast out.  You should be never be allowed have children.   Sorry ass people like you should just do whats right and leave. Jack Burrell should be casterated on one of the fields. Unfortunately, he already has kids who might? Already be causing trouble at Fairhope High School.  I know Jack has and is. Man up Chief!  Check with the police department. What if we have a real regional tournament.  There is no room for anything whatsoever!!!   Can’t even park vehicles having a small local tournament????
