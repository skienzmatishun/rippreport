 Presently the only ways to mitigate the virus is by identifying Catalysts through campaign reports.  Once a Catalyst has been identified, public knowledge is the key.  Dissemination to other voters in the identification of a Catalyst is helpful
We are working on a vaccine but that will not be until the next elections 
So for now, know who has the Catalyst virus, inform others and social distance yourself 
Catalyst carriers are known to be found in churches, social events, and city festivals 
When going to council and county meetings stay at least six feet away to protect t yourself from vagaries and untruths
