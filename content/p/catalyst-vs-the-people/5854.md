 Yep.  Armstrong is from Timbercreek  out of the council members from that district most of them were appointed and never had to run for election
Timbercreek is in Daphne but those people think they are in Spanish Fort.   Hell I say let Spanish Fort have them and their sewers.  Oh wait Spanish Fort calls itself a city but they literally have to suck off of Daphne and other cities for water sewer jail, and power
You guys up there in North Daphne should have thought about what it takes to be a REAL town before you incorporated yourselves 
Like a teenager wanting to move out in his own but wanting mom and dad to pay for rent and utilities
