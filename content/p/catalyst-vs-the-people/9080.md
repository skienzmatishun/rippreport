 I have asked many people many times why impact fees are not charged to developers and the answer I get is because Catalyst mandates that the politicians they own will never impose impact fees.  This is correct because I already knew the answer and just wanted to see how many others knew.  
See all  this infrastructure that the overgrowth is mandating?  The developers should pay for these but Catalyst keeps Those from happening and we citizens bear the brunt of the cost.
This is why I have made sure since 2000 when I first became aware of this group I would make sure I would not ever vote for a politician that uses Catalyst because Catalyst makes sure the politicians they own will never vote for impact fees
Now that more and more are becoming aware of how this group operates, Catalyst will probably change its name like it did when Haygood and Elliot got into office.
