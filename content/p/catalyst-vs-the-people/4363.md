 Fairhopians act like their sh*t doesnt' stink. Always have. Well, now they are wallowing in it. Who in their right mind would move there? grinder pumps at every neighborhood inside  the city limits. crap being pumped in the gulleys. A corrupt council stealing from the airport and doing clandestine things there. No ethics. Each councilman has interests in real estate development...the development that is ripping our tiny community to pieces. Quality of Life? That don't matter to these jerks.
