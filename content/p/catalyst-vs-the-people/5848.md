 CLEAN THE HOUSE 
And not one person ever says a word about that good ol boy, Joe! You know the quiet one. He never utters a word cause he knows he is dumb and doesn’t have a clue. Poor old man! Hate to even bring it up, but he is such a poor representative. But because he is so friendly no one wants to hurt his feelings. But how does that help us? It doesn’t and he is doing a disservice to his constituents. 
Will them Dems take him down? It is time to put his old butt to pasture. 
Talk about laughin’ stock in Montgomery. I hear they lead him round by his nose. 
I am embarrassed- Baldwin County should be too! He has been paid by our taxes too long!
