 Read about the circuit court ruling in Fairfield, Alabama, the council defunded a position and the mayor took it to court, the court ruled with the council, stating: "...state law allows for the city council to defund any position...just as it can fund a position..." Got that form the real Jester, looked it up and as usual, the Jester was right!
