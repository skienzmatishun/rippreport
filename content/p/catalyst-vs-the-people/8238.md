 I routinely hear people (that have never attended/watched a City Council meeting and can't even VOTE here because they live outside the limits) trash Mayor Wilson for all of the bad spending decisions that she has actually stated her opposition to.  The former Mayor Kant and at least some of the current CC members blame her for every mistake that they have made and continue to make.  It is shocking to see such ignorance in 2020.  However, these same people would vote Roy Moore for President.  Alabama may be doomed already, but please help kick out the greedy CC members (you know who they are) this year so that Fairhope is not doomed.
