 So why don’t you counter these allegations?   If they are not true then state SPECIFICALLY what is inaccurate.   I want to believe the current power structure,  HELP ME BELIEVE.
So far no one has come forward in this forum refuting specifics.  This is leading me to believe that Ripp is actually into something and Catalysts are questionable.
I have actually done some research into Ripp’s allegations and I see where he is right - so where is he inaccurate?
