 Call BS on the crap Hoss Mack, Chris Elliott and Tucker Dorsey pulled off the other day. The sheriff and 2 County Commissioners flying to Washington about illegal aliens possibly coming to Alabama. The Sherriff needs to go, DUI Chris Elliott has already given up his County Commissioner job and Tucker will soon be defeated in the run off. Bradley Bryne, don’t think you can hide. You endorsed these shits and didn’t even mention why them and no other County Commissioner. Between y’all and Eddie Tyler, we are tired of y’all rubbing it in our face. Do you think we are that Stupid???  Byrne, the puppet of Washington. What would you really do without Austal or Airbus. Probably spending more of the money that “WE” pay you by defending the Porch Creek Indians of not paying taxes. Have you ever F ing ask the people who elected you what we thought about this subject. Austal and Air Bus was here before you were elected.  So what have you done??? DUI Chris Elliott, all of you are going straight to hell. This group is the most hypocritical bunch in Baldwin County. Take scumbag Judge Thomason with y’all. She is going to hell. Heck of a Rant??? Just check out the things mentioned in this post. ALL FACTS!!!!
