 done deal goes back to the deal made with 2 devils at the crossroads at midnight a long long tme ago...nix aka squire of fairhope and saint corte..nothing anyone could have done no matter the outrage, most haven't a clue as to our shameful political history...taxpayers are footing bill on new entrance and coming soon, expansion of parker road to hwy 13...excuse will be emergency vehicle ingress and egress on 98 too congested...truth, it opens a taxpayer funded road thru corte family property for more development, same reason hwy 13  was expanded and opened to daphne, also courtesy of taxpayers and part of original crossroads at midnight deal...
