 To the Editor: Many of us here in Fairhope like to take our dogs to outdoor restaurants.  Mr. Manelos was definitely not advocating for dogs INSIDE of restaurants.  Venues such as Sunset Pointe with large outdoor dining spaces have always welcomed well-behaved dogs.  Also, trying to  tie Manelos to the oil spill is akin to saying that every single employee of the City of Fairhope, including Mayor Wilson, is dumping millions of gallons of sewage into the bay constantly.  Surely you see the problem in trying to paint everyone with the same brush......just as there are certainly some who work for the City that hate seeing the Bay polluted with sewage, there are many who worked for BP, including Manelos, that were devastated by the oil spill.  Also, I think our Mayor and City Council hired Pittman, not BP.
