 Oh stuff it Churchgoer.   You are either naive or you think we buy this bull that just because you go to church you are holy
Are you trying to fool us or fool yourself?
Either way you imply that people go to church just to be seen.  This is not Christian by hypocritical.  The hypocrites were the ones that made Christ mad
