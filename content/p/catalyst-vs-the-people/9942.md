 Just look for the pvc signs
If you want names then see for yourself on the Secretary of State website on campaign reports
You Will see the donations from all the developers
Prebble DR Horton Columbia Southern Truland Corte Cox
They funnel money to the vetted politicians.  Catalyst checks out and picks the politicians and signs them on then the developers fund the politicians and the politicians pay Catalyst. Like a Triangle Trade you read about in colonial times
Catalyst then keeps the politicians in line. If an opposing candidate runs and seems to be a threat,  Catalyst will threaten 
I knew a certain Catalyst tried to intimidate the cousin of an opponent.  That Catalyst told the cousin “I represent every sitting just get in this county and you donot want to run against my client because you will lose and you will have to face a judge that I represent.”  The opposing politician ran for Commissioner 
I know this because I was in politics 
Catalyst does better at running “at large”rather than at district levels.  This keeps the votes diluted.

It is for the same reason why Daphne closed the minority precincts in the 2016 election
Catalyst is smart and stacks the deck
