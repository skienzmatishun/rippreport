 They are too busy paying the mortgages of the overpriced houses that they bought in the cookie cutter subdivisons.  They think that just because they live in a house that is twenty miles east of the Bay that they can tell their friends that they are trying to impress that they live in Fairhope. Actually they are living in a former pecan orchard or cow pasture that they overpaid for the small lot.  They are not as smart as they would want you to think that they are.
Just look at one of the big houses that is squeezed on a small lot that in an overpriced subdivision with a fancy name.  Just because they have granite countertops and a two car garage doesn't mean it is really worth what they are paying.  Yet these people get in line to buy one of the toothpick houses just because they can pick out the color of the paint.
