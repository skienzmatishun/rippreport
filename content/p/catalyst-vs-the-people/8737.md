 Currently the only test for the Catalyst virus is by measuring the behavior of a Catalyst.   Once a person is infected with the Catalyst virus he or she will seek out other victims to make sweetheart deals with.  Initial places will be in churches to give the appearance of phony Christian conservative behavior 
The next behavior will be running for office and taking campaign money from developers
The only way to check for infection is to check campaign finance reports to see if the infection has passed from Catalyst donors to Catalyst candidates.  Not voting for a Catalyst infected candidate is the main way to stop furthering the spread 
Remember social distancing and washing hands after handling dirty catalyst money
