 Agreed. The part that troubles me most is creating an unfunded job and having the new guy independent of the Chief and reporting to the Mayor. She has some good points but all that will happen is the guy doesn't have a job. He sounded good but you have to wonder why he did not know the rules.  Communication is a two way street , Mayor.  I think some council members and the Mayor need to reset and try again to work harmoniously.  No one is perfect. Start from there.
