 No one wants damaged goods. Look up Tucker Dorsey in the encyclopedia under worthless and there is a high resolution picture of himself holding a Bible and quoting scriptures that he will never abide by because he know not if the True God that we Christians worship. Chris Elliott is sitting next to him in the picture. Remember this Christians, when you go to the polls. Out with Chris Elliott also. Same as Tucker Dorsey. If they want to pull the Christian Card out. We will take it away from them and give it to someone who is a true Christian. Shove that you are a Christian down my throat everyday tells me that you are up to NO GOOD. But yâ€™all have already proven that!
