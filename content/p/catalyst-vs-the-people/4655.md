 Lets go further back and ask Buck Benton.  Ask Jimmie Johnson.  For those of you that are new to Baldwin County, Benton Was the sheriff in the 1970's and Johnson was the sheriff in the 1980's.  I could go further back to the days of Taylor Wilkins, but most of you were not even born then.
Anyway, my point is all these sheriffs are and were good people.  Nothing bad I am saying or implying. I just think they should be APOLITICAL.  A good apolitical sheriff will humbly thank any political compliment and then graciously distance himself (or herself, one day) in order to uphold the law.  I am reinforcing the previous post.
