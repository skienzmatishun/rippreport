 Republican, conservative, relgious run on that ticket and you can't lose in Baldwin county! If she doesn't succeed in her bid for Montgomery I can promise you, she will get re-elected in Baldwin county! This is our big chance to get her out of Baldwin county! Also in Montgomery she will be part of a panel she won't be making sole rulings therefore she will be able to do less damage than she is doing now in Baldwin county. This is a case of if you can't beat them join them. Please folks don't let this opertunity pass us by to finally get rid of her and place her in a position where she isn't the sole decision on a case. Please think of the innocent children in her courtroom now please give them a chance vote to send her to Montgomery.
