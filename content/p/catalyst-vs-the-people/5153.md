 Not likely.  There are too many federal criminals in office for the FBI to have time to chase down the state criminals, particularly when the voters in the state overwhelmingly believe that no crime is indefensible as long as the criminal is a 'Christian'.  Fairhope would eagerly appoint Roy Moore to the Supreme Court.  It is incomprehensible to me.
