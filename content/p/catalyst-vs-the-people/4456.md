 I have no evidence to support this supposition, but recent comments have made me wonder.  I have yet to understand why more people don't vocally lodge complaints against the Council (primarily Burrell (and to a lesser extent, Boone &amp; Brown).
I am wondering if the relationship between the Council (3 B's) and the Police Dept (Chief Petties and everyone who must report only to him) is the reason.  Do residents of Fairhope fear for their well being if they complain?  I have no idea and have had no interaction with the Police Department other than a traffic ticket warning, but people appear awkward about even discussing the Council situation.  Most people with whom I discuss the 'daily news' abhor Boone, Brown &amp; Burrell, but they appear frightened to 'upset the applecart'.   
This is really scary.  We need to find great candidates that can be elected so that residents no longer need to fear repercussions from supposedly the "next Mayor Kant".......does he miss his alleged PPB? Or does Kant need to return to turn the Bluff property into another 'luxury apartment complex'?
