 Sorry!  Off subject. Saw Former Baldwin DA Whetstone on channel 15. Seemed just as Drunk as he always has been, including in the courtroom. It’s a shame that we have not had a decent DA with some Integrity, for sometime now. Mobile hasn’t had one with any integrity for many years as well. So, what’s that day for Mobile and Baldwin Counties?  The past 10-15 years we have had nothing but bullcrap for people who are serving in political positions. Serving the public had become a greed position!!!  Nothing else!
