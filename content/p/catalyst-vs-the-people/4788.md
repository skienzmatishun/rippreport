 Looking forward to the catalysts taking out the Fairhope Mayor and when elected fireing all her overpaid no clue supervisors. Wow just wow how bad things are in Fairhope. All the good employees are looking for other jobs and quitting one by one. That says a lot about the leadership. Really looking forward to Rowdy out there Ripps comments after the municipal elections.
