 Sherry Sullivan is probably a nice person (most who worked with her at the City disagree), but she has no clue what it would take to be Mayor of Fairhope.  She has a high school education and never had any real responsibilities with the City because of her close relationship with the Mayor (from my research of former media articles).  Fairhope is not a lip on a highway; we need a Mayor with credentials.  She was disrespectful (and worse) to Mayor Wilson after Wilson was kind enough to keep her on as a city employee.  Sullivan then sued Fairhope.......please don't elect this person!
