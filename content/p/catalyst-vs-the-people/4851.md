 Those people disagreeing with Ripp still cannot answer about the overflowing sewers.  The cities of Daphne and Fairhope are still putting in more and more houses and not doing anything about the sewage going into the bay.  This is factual.  So this is one of many facts that Ripp is addressing and nobody can deny this. Even Mobile Bay Keepers are mad at Daphne about the raw sewage being pumped into Mobile Bay.  So to those disagreeing with Ripp, why is there nobody addressing the sewage?  
One cannot say that what Ripp publishes is inaccurate.  He publishes his claims and imbeds the sources right in his articles. 
Oh, and yes, I DO live in Fairhope and have lived here for longer than most of you have been alive.  I have seen in just the past eight years how the overcrowding has hurt us here in Baldwin County.  The past eight years correlates with the current county administration as well as the Daphne and Fairhope administration.
People are beginning to notice what is happening and are asking questions.
