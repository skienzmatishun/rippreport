 Ripp, now that Catalyst has “Gone to ground” and changed its name to Boone Consulting, is it still accurate to refer to this network of politicians as “Catalyst?”
Back when Catalyst was called Elliot, Haygood and Stacey, it benefitted from having a computer robo-dialing program due to the fact that one of the partners was a computer student in Georgia
Before those days when it was just Lynne Stacey, this group knew how to make elections tip to preferred candidates 
We still have “The Machine,” where political candidates are vetted, hooked up to developers, bought by the developers and the politicians are controlled by the developers.  What should we call this “Triangle Trade” of graft and greed?
