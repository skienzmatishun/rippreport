 It was a corporation and there were multiple principals. I don't think you can find out from public records the percentage each principal owns (stock) One is a pretty close relative of this Corte guy but their name is different. So it works out to around 12k/acre which is pretty strong for a large tract. Usually the bigger the tract the lower/acre.  By not selling the county misses out on what ? $ 300000/ year property taxes. Of course proceeds could pay down  lot of debt.  I am guessing after 6 years of recovery the land may be worth 1/2 what the county paid for it. What is so astounding is that a county like Baldwin would spend so much for one purchase. This would be a big deal even if the state spent that much. The DA should have called a Grand Jury to investigate this. I am sure the statute of limitations is in play now but I don't know for certain. So I am saying there are people besides the commissioners who didn't do right. Even if they didn't make money they didn't do their job like they should have.  This should have all been common knowledge years ago but seems like no one knows much.
