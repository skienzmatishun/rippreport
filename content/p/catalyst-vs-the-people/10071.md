 Actually, the Ripp Report is not reporting the entire truth here.  Yes, I am pretty sure that Sherry is financed by Corte and Kant, but Ripp doesn't care about Fairhope if he is leaving out of his 'reporting' the fact that John Manelos can manage 'catalyst' and Burrell.  I always looked to Ripp for facts, but he is so controlled by Karin that he won't even report  the facts.  I don't know anyone who will support Karin again, but Ripp pretends that we don't have other options.  We do...we have John Manelos who is not beholden to anyone and has not accepted any developer cash at all.
