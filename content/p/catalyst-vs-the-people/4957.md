 Michele Thomason made a travesty of my divorce case. I filed for divorce because my ex was cheating on me. Thomason allowed the proceedings to drag on for inconsequential reasons for at least two years then allowed my ex to file for bankruptcy, without informing me about it, during the time she said she was going to sign the divorce decree.  My ex passed away from heart conditions nine days after filing his bankruptcy and before Thomason signed the decree.  Thomason then tried to pre-date a divorce decree for four months before his death. The bankruptcy would not allow this.  She makes up her own rules and left me with a mess that I could do nothing about.  Don't let her screw up anyone else's life.
