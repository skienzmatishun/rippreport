 Dear Mr Anon,
While you have identified those infected with the Catalyst virus, once these specific cases have been mitigated, there are still others and will be others who may contract this disease 
In addition, this virus may mutate into another strain by another name.  The Catalyst virus is a virus in a group of political machine viruses.
Diligence in research to see the financial  source campaign contributions is one reliable method in identifying the successor of the Catalyst virus once it mutates and evolved
