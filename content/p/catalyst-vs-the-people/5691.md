 Ripp you deserve some type of medal for fighting corruption. Baldwin County is more corrupt than many of the third world countries I've lived in as a career military man.
It is indeed more than sad that the people are so gullible and pliable. No one says anything. Everyone goes about their merry way. Meanwhile, the place they call home is being slowly transformed for the bad.

Ripp the machine (catalyst) is not going to allow their grip to be loosened. Elliot is their b*tch and he is going in, by hell or high water. The money is there to put him in. With another low turnout it will easily happen. If the vote is close they'll say "2,000 people didn't turn their ballot over"and fix it.

You must understand that this is how these people make a living. A good one.The system supports hundreds of near do wells who have no reason making the kind of money they do off the public trough.

I commend you Rippster but I think this place is toast.
