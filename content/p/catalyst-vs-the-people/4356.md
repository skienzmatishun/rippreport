 JT6?  Does  that stand for Jerk Tim ((Kant) off 6 times. Just got off the phone. Everything has been not been dismissed yet. Bet you $5000 it won’t be without a settlement. Jack Burry has already stated if if it was good for the city of Fairhope, that he wouldn’t even apologize if it were to be dropped just on a simple “I’m sorry”. He has tile everyone. Not that most of these people we give a crap about in the first place. Go sell your shit Jester, on another site or better, another state. Prick!
