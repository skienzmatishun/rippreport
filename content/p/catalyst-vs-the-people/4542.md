 This is my prediction:

Tucker makes the runoff with Billie Jo. In the runoff he is fully exposed. The dirt by this time will surface and will show up right here on the Ripp Report. Sad we get no coverage in America anymore. We get no local political coverage. Other than Paul Ripp. Think about that. That guy chuckee is on the payroll for Burrell and Boone.

Northcutt makes the runoff with Boyd. Boyd will be exposed by Ripp. More to come here too. Northcutt is the stronger candidate.

Michelle Thomason wins her appeal court race and Baldwin county residents are finally releived of her on the bench.
