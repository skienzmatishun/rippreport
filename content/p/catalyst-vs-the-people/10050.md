 Chris Warner said it best, eventhough he really expounded - whew!
In summary, Ripp is the David against the Goliath Catalyst.
Ripp has been threatened to be locked up and sued.  He remained firm on his beliefs.
Ripp is now giving us the courage to wake up and take on this political machine.
Catalyst, you wanted growth.  Now there are people moving into this area that will NOT put up with your good ole boy tactics.  Did you not consider this or did you think you could keep the crookedness up?  
Here, Catalyst you made a strategic mistake.
Yes, I know Catalyst is no longer a legal entity.  By Catalyst I mean the politicians who are owned by the developers and funnel their money through campaign contributions through a company whether it be called Catalyst, EHS, or Scott Boone Consulting.
Boone must have been real stupid to think that just by changing the name would cover his tracks - how naive...
