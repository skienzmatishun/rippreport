 Opposite of Catalyst: Harry Still III.  Came in last in District race in Bay Minette in 2016. Running for mayor this year. Ordered 250 signs and canâ€™t get anyone to put in their yard. I predict he gets less than the 23% he got in 2016. 

Burrell, Boone and Brown all win with almost identical 68% victory. 

Carey wins with no runoff. 

Your Illuminati theory blows up in your face and the work of Baldwin County continues with you spitting in the wind. Good people stepping up for public service and doing what is right despite your lies, innuendo and half truths.   You think you can run off good public servants by conspiracy theories but you are wrong.   Good people will continue to step up and give of their time and treasure.
