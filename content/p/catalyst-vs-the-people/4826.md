 I guess because your relatives helped others found Fairhope generations ago that makes you special. Some would call you entitled.  Your post does not make good sense either.
“ To see this guy move on and do what he is to this town is awful .”   I am speculating that you are a very senior citizen unhappy with change.....  People who post like you make me want to do the opposite of what they advocate.  Some of your apparent adversaries are idiotic also but you seem to be the worse.  I don’t like writing negative posts so I won’t say any of this again. This blog needs everyone to be more considerate. You can criticize someone, especially someone who is not an elected official, without being so hateful. And, yes, that goes BOTH ways.
