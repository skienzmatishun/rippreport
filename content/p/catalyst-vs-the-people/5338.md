 It’s all adding up. Sheriff Hoss Mack has always been sorry. He’s just gotten stupid hanging around the rest of the Catalyst. Enjoy your next 4 year Hoss. Once we get rid of Elliott. The F ing boxing gloves come off!!!! MF traitor is what you truly are. Lost your mind and started killing folks. My my. What a tangled web you weave. Should have just kept you mouth shut. Now we see that you and the Catalyst are running scared.  People. Don’t vote for Catalyst unless you are just another sorry ass person who doesn’t give 2 shits about Baldwin County!!
