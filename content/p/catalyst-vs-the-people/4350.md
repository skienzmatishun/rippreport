 It is so sad. Our City Council and Baldwin officials appear to all be serving the interests of out-of-state developers/bankers.
They are making bank and will disappear to the next hot spot after they have drained Fairhope/South Baldwin of any resources/quality of life, aided and abetted by our very own Burrell, Boone &amp; Brown.  It is so sad that the voters here are so stupid and lazy and are complacently led like sheep to slaughter.  (Look at Destin, Florida and know that we will soon be in Destin's hell, minus the beautiful beach!).
Certainly Mayor Wilson makes mistakes; we all do.  However, I have yet to see any of her mistakes that resulted from greed. She is trying to do the best for our City and is being kicked in the teeth by our horrible Council constantly.  I wish that I believed that the election outcome would be better next time, but Fairhope's voters are uninformed and lazy.  How can we wake them up?????
