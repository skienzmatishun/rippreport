 Hey “Hoax Buster” 
Keep trying to make people think Catalyst is  an Illuminati thing.
How do you explain the hundreds of thousands of dollars going from developed to Catalyst candidates to Catalyst, formerly Elliot, Haygood, and Stacy?
Many of us are well aware of Stacy since the late 1970’s.   We also know that in order for this outfit to run your campaign you would have to agree to a certain platform when you got in office
You dismissing Catalyst might make newcomers think Catalyst is a figment if Ripp’s imagination bit many of us old timers here in Baldwin know of Catalyst and what it does
Go sell your lies to the ignorant on another forum because as Ripp gets the word out more and more Catalyst will change its name again 
Now answer these questions or go back to your hole and tell your Catalyst bosses that you FAILED
