 If you are new then DO listen to Ripp.   I can bet I have been in this town decades longer than Andrews and will testify to what Ripp claims.
Ripp has exposed more corruption than anyone else.   If Ripp is a little crazy which makes him fearless to the corrupt politicians.  Ripp has been threatened to be thrown in jail by the Corrupt City Politicians.   Did Ripp run and hide? No, Ripp sued - AND WON.
To others he may seem crazy or senile but actually he is passionate and fearless.
