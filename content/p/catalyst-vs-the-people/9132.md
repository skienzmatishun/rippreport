 When are you going to start writing about other incidents at the bars? Continued drug transactions at L.W.C.C. (mind you all you have to do is sit in the establishment and observe). No to mention the ongoing issues with arrests there in general. How about the girl that was raped outside of PLOW. Maybe even write about the sexual allegations against Nall by a young man. Perhaps that doesn’t serve your own personal brand of catalyst. McSharry is by no means of a saint, but he isn’t the only ugly thing to write about. You also have the mayor’s sister and nephews. Big time marijuana users. Hopefully you eventually start being fair and balanced. FYI: I wish the public would call on Denardi to pass a drug test. Huge addict! Also, there’s no proof she had a concussion. But she won’t release medical records. 

FYI: The redundancy of the Jack Burrell burger. That menu item is at Bone &amp; Barrel.
