 So the Council wants to throw a party with Sullivan as the head?  It will be kind of like a campaign event for her and Catalyst.
These guys are so predictable to those of us who are WOKE.
To the rest of the people in Fairhope who do not know what is going on, then this looks like a cute event.
I say let Catalyst throw the "party" and make the Mayor be the head.
