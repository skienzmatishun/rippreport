 I guess Sherry couldn't make the debate because she was busy getting ready for her hillbilly parade today.  It was pitiful; several pick up trucks with their horns blasting obnoxiously circling downtown.  Fairhope deserves better than an uneducated traitor that think that the way to get votes is by driving through town honking her horn and scaring people.  No class whatsoever!
