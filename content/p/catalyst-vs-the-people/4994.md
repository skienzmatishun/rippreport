 From reading Tucker Dorsey's blog site, it appears to me that Dorsey is trying to explain his reasons for his "pro-growth" position.  Too bad so many people see through his B.S. and know he is just sucking any future life out of the county for his own personal gain before he moves back to Georgia.  I hope the voters send him back next month.
