 I want to be a Deacon in this "Church."  When is the pork dinner being served?  Also, do we REALLY have to be true Christians, or just look that way to the gullible electorate.  My true Gods are money, power, and being able to be above the law. Of course this church must have children because we need to use them for political props.  All we have to do is say "But it is for the children..."
Our biggest donors are Truland, Bellaton, and D.R. Horton.  Our Pope Emeritus is Lynn Stacey and his alter boy is Scott Boone.
I think I would fit right in.
