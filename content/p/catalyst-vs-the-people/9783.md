 Ripp....u know who I am, we were once friends and I miss my friend....u have never supported or approved of any elected official in fairhope since u moved here. U created Burrell and this current council because u disapproved of everyone, went after all of them with a " full metal jacket". The only person u ever supported was Karin (Mosher) but refuse to comprehend u r being used because of your blog. U said u "quit" after next election...why? U will ansolutely never be satisfied until everyone agrees with u...u faught in Vietnam but have morphed into a government loving to be controlled follower....so disappointed in u and Warner, who manages your site and posts....
