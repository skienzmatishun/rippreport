 It’s like looking up a Mafia member.  They don’t put out a catalog about themselves for the general public.  One way is to ask a politician who is a Catalyst.  Watch them get very defensive.  I have asked several politicians who are Catalyst and I got responses ranging from it being none of my business to evasiveness.
The LLC is on the Sec of State site.  Their activity is listed as “any lawful activity.”  That doesn’t tell you much so go ask any Baldwin County politician and see for yourself. Just bring your barf bag with you.
