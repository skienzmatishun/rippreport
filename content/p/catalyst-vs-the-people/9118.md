 One of the Council guys told the mayor"nobody believes you".    About sums it up for her one term administration.   Her lies about the police department money she misapprehended for her spy operation, her assault of an employee, lies about other long term employees, intentional fraud against Lakewood Country Club ...it is a pattern with her.   She almost bankrupted her own grandmother's business and her time as mayor has been a disaster.  Fairhope deserves better than this crazy idiot in her office.
