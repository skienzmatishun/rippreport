 Karen is a prejorative term for a person perceived to be entitled or demanding beyond the scope of what is considered appropriate or necessary. A common stereotype is that of a white American middle-aged woman who displays aggressive behavior when prevented from getting her way; such women are often depicted as demanding to "speak to the manager", and of having a particular bob cut hairstyle.
