 Irony is justice sometimes. Think about it. Jack and the B's flooded FH with new development. Now there are 10,000 new voters who want fairhope to stop growing so they can enjoy it. Hard to convince folk to vote against their families. The only people voting against Karin are the old money who want to sell land and develop.
