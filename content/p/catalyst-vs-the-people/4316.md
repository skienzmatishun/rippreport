 No shocking news, but we had a wonderful tough ethics bill crushed again this week in Alabama. They donâ€™t want to hold  politicians  accountable who break the law or act in any unethical was. Amazing!  Not really. You would be hard pressed to find any politician that has 100% ethics value much less any politician that had any whatsoever!
