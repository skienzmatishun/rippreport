 The Catalyst gangsters twisted arms.  Don’t you see what Ripp is harping on?   They get their way.  As soon as you turn your back, Catalyst sneaks in and gets their way
Go ask your council members why they let it go through.   They will tell you crap about lawsuits.   Catalyst gave the council members cover so the council members can say “We can’t do anything but we tried.”
Don’t underestimate these people.  They have been doing this for years and are very connected.   Do you think one single council meeting with a bunch of protestors is going to stop this when they have been doing this for so long?
