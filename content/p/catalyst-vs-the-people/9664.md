 Dear  Catalysts, Corte, developers, and good ole boys:
We know you read this blog.  In your greed to overdevelopment you failed to consider that as you overdeveloped this area you would bring in more voters who wanted to shut the door behind them.  Now you have it where you cannot control all the voters with your Catalyst campaign clique now known as Boone Consulting.  Imagine that Ripp made you have to change your name.  And you all say nobody listens to Ripp.  You sure do ha!
I have watched over the years as you all have pillaged this place.  May you experience a building bubble and it pops on you 
But it already did with Corte because he went bankrupt
