 Yep, so have I.  The FBI comes to Fairhope so the Feds can get out of Mobile, eat at a few nice places for the per diem, and have a mini-vacation.  There will not be anything coming out of this - until a few agents want to get out of the office in Mobile and open up another investigation.
Shoot, the next time they show up, the city employees will just hand them a lunch voucher for Panini Pete's and everything will be good.
