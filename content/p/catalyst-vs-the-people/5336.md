 Sherrif Hoss Mack is Soley responsible for not just killing the man in the trailer, but Might as well call it murder. Hoss is crooked and a Catalyst supporter all the way. Anyone that gets in bed with Trip Pittman and DUI Chris Elliott, are as nasty as they come.  We don’t need to vote a drunk like DUI Chris Elliott for anything and let’s not forget about the other (only for himself) politician Tucker Dorsey who is worse than Trip Pittman (almost as bad) that slimes around with Sherriff Hoss Mack and DUI Chris Elliott. It’s enough to make you throw up. Hoss Mack, you could consider it murder of the trailer park Dude ad the blame starts at the top and we know that’s not all. How about your buddy in Robertsdale running for Baldwin County Coroner. I’ve seen some nice checks that have been paid to him for several years now after you set him up for payments for just being on call.  That’s your doing as well. More things to come. How stupid are you and Wilters to be involved in a commercial sponsoring a person running for Judge. Your morals are disgusting and the catalyst around you are even worse!!!!!
