 I went before Judge Scully in civil court and he lied right to my face, claiming that my landlord had no obligation to maintain the premises because I was on a month to month lease. That is incorrect. 

Looking back, I should have appealed but the house was uninhabitable at that point so I moved out of the state. 

I still can't believe he lied right to my face but he did!
