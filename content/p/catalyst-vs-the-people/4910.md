 As I remember we had a surprising 3-2 vote on Fly Creek. Burrell switched his initial vote from yes and voted nay, Boone stayed a yes, but the new members voted 2-1 in favor. I had expected Brown to vote yes and Conyers no and I thought Robinson would also be a no but he got concerned about a potential lawsuit. ????( He definitely would have been a nay in 2016.)
I heard that might have been a Corte bluff . Even then I hoped the Planning people would make Corte scale back some but he apparently is clear cutting the entire tract. I donâ€™t know the regulations but it sounds like he is pushing this to the limit. Our only defense I can see is to fine them every time that they they break the slightest rule but all that will do is slow them up for next time.
Looking ahead the best defense is to watch whom you vote for and for the City to raise impact fees and rules to the limit. Also we need to be careful when we try to annex land. The developers love big empty tracts where they can clear land and tap into the Fairhope water/sewer systems.
