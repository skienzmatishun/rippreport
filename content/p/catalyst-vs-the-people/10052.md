 Have you ever noticed that these three little P’s are not willing to scream at a grown man. When Mayor Wilson’s Husband spoke out at a Fairhope Council meeting the three P’s (Burrell, Boone abs Burrell) faces where white as a sheet and were scared to death to talk back to him or bully him or treat him like they do the Mayor and other women in this city. They know they will get the sorry asses whooped if they talk disrespectful and loud to the men of this town.  It’s now time for the women to step up against the 3 P’s and the men of Fairhope need to quit being little babies and hold them accountable for disrespecting the women as well as all the people of Fairhope.  If you don’t stand up against the assault these three P’s are dishing out then you certainly don’t care how your kids are raised and you yourself have no respect for your own daughters or granddaughters. By the way. The P stand for “PRICKS” because that’s not only how they act but WHO they really are. The three BBB’s are mostly known and the 3 P’s!!!!
