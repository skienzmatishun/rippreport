 The meeting was actually fairly short. The Mayor campaigned for 15 minutes during her comment period. She lied about current City debt and transfers from Utility.  20 minutes was the boy scouts.  The meeting only went a little over an hour.  The mayor's lies and boy scouts took up the bulk of time.
