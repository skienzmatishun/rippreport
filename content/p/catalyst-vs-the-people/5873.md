 Do we really expect any of the tv media let alone the crippled Mobile Press Register to cover any news other than the stories it’s “journalists” think we should know?   I often look at the Mobile Press Register as it sits in the sales rack and I just want to see what it is covering and not covering.   It is a shame to see what it tries to pass off as news including Shoe Station ads.  I donot even think about buying a copy. I just feel hurt when I think of the paper it was 40 years ago compared to the shill it is today for fluff
