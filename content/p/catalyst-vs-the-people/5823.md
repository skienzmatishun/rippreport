 Tripp Pittman, Tucker Dorsey, Michelle Thomason, Chris Elliott, Eddie Tyler, Hoss Mack. These are just a few republicans that have made Baldwin County the Laughing Stock of Alabama. Dammit, Alabama gets laughed at enough without Laughing at one of its own Counties. Piss on the Republican Party if the above people represent all of us being republicans. Screw them and screw all of the republicans who have voted or supported any of these individuals. Iâ€™m now an independent and will vote from now on to keep the Shit above from tearing our county apart!!!
