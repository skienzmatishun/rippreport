 I am tired of poop in the bay. There's a lot of it and it is the number one problem fairhope has, other than this city council. They are rude and they appear to be less than forthright when it comes to scrutiny of their actions.  I think they will eventually all get beat. I can't see Jack winning. His police report is bigger than his ego.  Boone looks like a Fairhope fat cat who makes money through various LLC's and local contracts he doles out to his son and his pals.  Robert Brown is the worst of the bunch in my opinion. He flaunts his wealth and status as councilman. The banker is running? I heard the attorney is not. Good for him. He sees his chances are slim and he knows that they have done a poor job. I respect Jay actually for being man enough to step down. The other four deserve what comes their way. Public service doesn't mean getting rich off the town.
