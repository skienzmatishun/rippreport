 Hoss Mack was included on the list due to the fact that his campaign signs are identical to all the Catalyst Candidates and he faces no candidates?? Another issue is Trip Pittman pushing legislation that rewrote the qualifications for sheriff that favored Hoss. Baldwin County is the ONLY county in Alabama with such qualifications.The Sheriff also seems to strongly support the present county commission which is Catalyst.I submit that Hoss linked himself to Catalyst. The Ripp Report is a strong supporter of police, municipal, state and county.
