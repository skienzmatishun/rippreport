 A friend pointed this post out to me. I did NOT post this and having lived only here 3 years, don't know the backstory on any of it or personally know any of the players. Either someone is maliciously posting using other people's names or this entire site is bogus. The owner might consider doing due diligence and ensuring/verifying that a post is real. To whomever posted in my name, use your own if you have any integrity or character although that seems unlikely. To the owner, you are perpetrating fraud by allowing people to post using other people's names.
