 Time to tell it like it is folks. Fairhope is no longer the cutesie artsy fartsie nirvana it was once perceived to be. The cat is out the bag. People now know about the crap in the bay and the traffic is getting worse it seems. Catalyst is sewing the seeds of destruction now. Put your house for sale and get out before the values start dropping. And they will.
