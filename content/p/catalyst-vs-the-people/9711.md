 I would sure like to meet this person who said Fairhope employees want Sherry. You’re in denial. Obviously you never worked for her. She is the most egotistical person I’ve ever met. Trust me all those posts are true. I need to speak up for my fellow co-workers. Please, vote for Karin. By the way, we all could get fired by Sherry, but at this point no one cares.  At this point it makes me sick that the people we work so hard day in and day out for would even consider Sherry.  Slap in the face.
