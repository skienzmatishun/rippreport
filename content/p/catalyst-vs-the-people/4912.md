 Horrible to have those hideous apartments here.  They will become run-down and Section 8/RentSupplement within 10 years.  The saddest thing of all is that there is no market for them. The Colonnade Apartments a few miles north in Daphne are not full......I drove through that hideous cookie cutter apartment on Section last weekend......they appear to be about 2% occupied (which is understandable b/c they are the ugliest housing units I have ever seen.  I can't believe that the city allowed them to build this monstrosity with no landscaping!
