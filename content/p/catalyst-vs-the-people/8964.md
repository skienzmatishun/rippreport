 Well, here we go!  I can’t wait to properly VET all the candidates. Speaking of dumb asses as mentioned in the article.  There had never been an election where the candidates have ever been vetted.  At least on the past 42 years that I know of. Don’t care if you are catalyst or a decent person. People in Fairhope!!! Get ready to rumble!  Our budget is unlimited for just this occasion. Fair warning, if you haven’t already filled out your papers, you have been advised. Lies that have been submitted on the past will not go untold this go around. Use Google??? You ask? Some maybe but boots on the ground interviewing will do the trick. Also what you may promise like the peckerwoods on the past have done only to backtrack on what they promised. Fly Creek for example?  Start your engines!
