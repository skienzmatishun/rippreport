 Each of the  three BBB’s have always been considered the three P’s. They were just disguised pricks before they were elected and now have been exposed to what they really are.  These 3 males, certainly not real men have terrorized the citizens of Fairhope and especially the women to the point of harassment. Of course it’s no secret that a lot of the males who support these pricks are no real men themselves. They walk around town thinking they are big shots all the while setting terrible examples for their own children  on how to treat women.  I’ve been to all the high society functions and have been a member of the clubs and organizations in Fairhope for years and have seen more and more disrespect towards the good people of Fairhope increase 10 fold just over the past few years. I’ll put the shoe on the other foot for a moment. If the women of Fairhope continue to allow the 3 BBB’s continue to abuse them, then they have no right to complain when their daughters get harassed or ends up in a abusing relationship. Isn’t it terrible that we are allowing the 3 BBB’s (especially Burrell and Boone) to act this way and to even be having a conversation about it. Don’t believe me?  Just watch online the city council meetings or better yet, just ask their wives.
