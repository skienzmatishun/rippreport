 That would make sense.  Robert happily approved Arthur Corte's zoning extension for the Fly Creek Apts during the building moratorium overriding Mayor Wilson's Veto (all councilmen wanted Arthur Corte to have his extension except for Jimmy) 

Robert pushed for giving away the Triangle property because Arthur was behind it.  Oh...and they're both mean-spirited.  Robert has fooled many people hiding behind Christian values and going to church.

Thank you Ripp for allowing residents to post here. All of this is recorded from public meetings.
