 While you were checking Karin, did you even bother to check Sherry and the Catalysts?  Hmmm?
You probably did not need to because you KNOW who is funding the Three B's and you are probably one of them or a developer that is funding them.
I would say "Nice try" but that wasn't even close.  You are pointing the finger at Karin and you have three more pointing back at you - just like the Three B's.
Try a little harder next time....
