 I was happy to see Billy Jo make it.  She will crush Tucker in the runoff. I was disappointed that Johnson and Lake did not make it.  I do not want to see Quitter Davis on the Commission.  So I will cross my vote in the General Election for that lady Democrat.  Some say she may be not up to speed but I met Davis at one of the Catalyst meet and greets and all he did was lecture me as if he knew it all.
Hey Catalyst!  Remember when Alabama voted in Doug Jones to keep Roy Moore out?  I am a Republican and I voted for Moore.  Just because you have infected the Republican Party here does not mean you are home safe.  Some will vote in the Democrats just to keep your bunch of crooks out.
You all laughed at Harry D'Olive.
