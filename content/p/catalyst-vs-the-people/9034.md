 I will run if I get support.  My three platforms would be no Catalyst, transparency, and I do not  own my council seat.   You will know where I will be coming from in advance so You can call me on what I propose.   Since Catalyst will oppose me and if I win then I will not owe them 
Should I run or should I support another candidate?   I want to be part of the Peopleâ€™s Choice
