 I was looking through those links: Those companies,  Baldwin Container, BCC Waste, Triple K Construction. They're all filed to the Florida Department of State as Foreign Limited Liability companies.
There are also, like Ripp said, closely connected together.

I checked the website and it's empty. Nothing is written. Just a shell almost.
I smell something extremely rotten...
