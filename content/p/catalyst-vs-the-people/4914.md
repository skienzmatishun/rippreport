 Mayor Wilson fought the good fight against the Apartments........no one can stop our corrupt City Council.  They lied to get elected and they will lie to be elected again.  Don't blame Wilson for any of this disastrous development.  Blame all of us who voted in Boone, Burrell and Brown (I voted for the latter 2......never again)!
