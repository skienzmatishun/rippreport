 Oh come on Ripp, COVID affects less than 1 percent and of test only 1 percent die.  So you want to shut down everyone’s lives for .0001 percent.  And of yesterday’s most of them have comorbidities.    Car wrecks do more
Ever heard of herd immunity?   Culling the herd?
Many of us are COVID weary.  Democrats have used this to destroy the economy 
If someone is immune compromised then they need to quarantine themselves and let those who are healthy enough to produce go to work.   Many of us are tired of being ruled by the weak!
