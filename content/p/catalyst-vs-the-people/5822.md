 Ripp, if Fisher is a Democrat then it is going to be HARD - REAL HARD - to get him elected in the General Election.  Baldwin County is very Republican, and so am I.
But I would NOT have any problem in crossing party lines for Jason or any other candidate.  As a matter of fact I know there are a total of three Democrats I am voting for this November and Jason is one of them.  The true Baldwin County Republican Party has been hijacked by the Catalysts.  
We just have to get the word out that voting for a few Democrats in November will keep the smug and cocky Catalyst crooks hiding out in the Baldwin County Republican Party (that has been stolen from the people) will be a cathartic action for the County Republican Party.  Of course, the Catalysts wearing the "Republican" brand will scream that voting for a local Democrat will be like voting for Nancy Pelosi and Obama, but actually voting for these LOCAL Democrats will be like chemotherapy for the Catalyst Cancer.  
I hope Mr Hoyt who heads the county "Republican" Party is reading this. I am calling you out.
Hoyt, your party has been infested and if you do not clean it up, the people will.  You have been shown this in the primaries.  Do not let the General Election have to remind you....
