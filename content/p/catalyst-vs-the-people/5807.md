 Man this is terrible. From someone that’s not clued in either way - you’re just making vague accusations. You don’t put a name to your allegations, and when you do you’re not specific. Who filed a complaint against the Mayor? For what? Was it even close to being deserved?  Is there a reasonable explanation?  The county commissioners business dealings are about to be exposed?  What business dealings?  If they’re not exposed yet how do you know what they are?  If you know what they are tell folks and not in some vague allegation. Lay it out. What’s the paper trail?  I’m a former active duty Navy guy who grew up locally and recently moved back so I don’t know either side, but you’re vague ramblings make me think you’re just mad about something personal and have no evidence to back up anything you say and are making it up.
