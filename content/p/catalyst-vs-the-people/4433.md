 I think Sheriff Hoss Mack stays pretty neutral. Naturally in his position, he will always be seen as supporting some of the candidates, but let just get this one FACT STRAIGHT!  Hoss is staying and thank God, insane and worst politician ever, Trip Pittman Os going. Next SUBJECT please!  This is old news now. Hoss stays  in and Pittman is out!  End of story! Next?
