 I am shocked and thankful that so far these Drunks which include Baldwin County Commissioner Tucker Dorsey who both have been seen many times  leaving certain places drunk, Baldwin County Commissioner Chris Elliott who is still driving around under the influence after recently getting a DUI and even Elliott ‘s Attorney Rob Stankoski drives around under the influence, have not ran over any of our kids or anyone else for that matter and either hurt them or killed them. You want a bunch of drunks in office and people who represent them too. I didn’t think so. Don’t vote for Tucker Dorsey or Chris Elliott or even do business with attorneys like Rob Stankoski who represents drunks just like himself or represented Chris Elliott who lies and now says he never has gotten a DUI. Stand up and do what’s right. Do not vote for these idiots. When they finally wreck while drinking and hurt somebody. Don’t think that you haven’t already been warned.
