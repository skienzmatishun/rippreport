 I live outside the city limits. Therefore I cannot vote. I hate the current people therefore they must be gone. I have hit the target but not the bullseye, therefore someone moved the target on me. I won a free speech lawsuit, therefore I should be editor of the paper. I am a white male, therefore I should be (fill in the blank) in order to speak at council meetings. I think the current mayor can do no wrong, therefore I must be right. The Fairhope gas system was shut down for violations therefore the former mayor from 4 years ago is to blame. The Ethics commission did not respond like I want them to do therefore they must be corrupt. My car battery died, therefore all Chevroletâ€™s are defective. Anyone see a pattern?
