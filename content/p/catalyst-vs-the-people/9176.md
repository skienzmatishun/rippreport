 they will not need to run.  Catalyst will make sure these guys get back in.  Just watch.  Catalyst is a smart group.  They know how to manipulate elections. last election in Fairhope they put just ONE election booth out in the parking lot to poll whether or not to go to district voting.  Catalyst insured that the people would not vote.
In Daphne, they shut down voting precincts in minority neighborhoods to keep the minority voters from voting.
Catalyst is S M A R T.   Don't just trust elections - these guys can change the rules
