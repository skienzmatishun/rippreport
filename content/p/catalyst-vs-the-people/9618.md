 You are referring to the elders, Jesus, and a harlot that was mentioned in the Gospel of John.   Jesus forgave the harlot and said Go and sin no more.‚Äù
This council has repeatedly screwed the town over and over and over.   They have gone and continued to sin
They may have some of the town folk thinking they are Christian but their actions show they are greedy sinners that are not repenting.
