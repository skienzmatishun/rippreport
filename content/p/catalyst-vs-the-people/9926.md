 Do you know where any Trussville Springs developments are here? The houses on their website do look pretty nice compared to the brick style house that make up 95% of the new developments. But the website is really old so I don't know.  I don't think it's so black and white.  There's going to be growth.  We need to do it right and fix and expand the infrastructure.  Not buy empty fields for millions of dollars.
