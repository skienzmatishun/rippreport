 Gotta love it.......he has done nothing illegal, which is the most horrifying thing about it.  How far up and down the food chain does this rampant theft from taxpayers of all levels reach?  Alabama legislators, through decades of elections, have known about this and have still done nothing about it.  It makes me wonder how much of the 'food money'  the legislators steal back from the sheriffs that stole from the taxpayers!
I love that the New York Post, Wash Post and other national/international media have picked up this story and are giving Alabama a lot of media attention.  Let's see who among our 'political leaders' makes a bid to end this exceedingly dishonest and immoral law.  
Seriously, $750,000 in three years?????  This story finally has legs!
