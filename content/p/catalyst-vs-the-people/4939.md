 Look up Secretary of State campaign reports of past candidates.   You will find “Catalyst” all over the payments.  I saw payments range from $2,500 a month to $5,000 depending on race.  Now look up contributions for this race for Catalyst.  You will find Volkert, Everwood, Real Estate PACs, and developers putting in the big subdivisions.  Some candidates will show tens of thousands of dollars in their accounts waiting to pay this group after the elections.
The politicians pay Catalyst after the voters vote so you will not find Catalyst on this year.  Catalyst is a ghost organization
Look up Kant, Haygood, Dorsey for 2014 and 2016.
