 Did Baldwin County Commissioner DUI Chris Elliott have a vehicle breathalyzer installed in his vehicle. I guess not since we have seen it start when it shouldn’t have!!  Oh well, drive on DUI Chris Elliott. You certainly won’t win the Alabama State Senate seat.  If you or any of the catalyst think so. I have some a few grand that I put on with you. He might get a couple more than Sorry Ass Trip Pittman did. But not many. Remember, Pittman only got 7% of the state’s votes. That was 3% less than the 10% I won 5 grand on!  DUI Chris Elliot. You are just another Trip Pittman. FINISHED!!!
