 So...Hoss Mack got together with Judge Smelly and killed that guy in a trailer when they ILLEGALLY tried to yank him out of his home! 

Now Hoss is rigging his sheriff race and trying to rig the other races in the district? 

Hoss seems hyper-political for a sheriff.

I did see he has yet to let on what he has done with his inmate food money.

Ripp is right. It may be time to toss hoss!
