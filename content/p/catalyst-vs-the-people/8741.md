 Mr Ripp,
Burrell’s behavior is a symptom of the Catalyst virus.  It’s not being a “piss poor negotiator” that is being manifested but rather his proclivity to male sweetheart land deals.   Not holding and environmental site evaluation was to sweeten the deal for the seller.   
In order to track the viral spread, we must see who the seller is and see if we can connect the seller to another Catalyst.
Remember the R0 (R naught) value.  This value measures the contagiousness and spread of the Catalyst virus
This virus is a highly contagious virus.  Social distancing must be maintained
