 I have learned on thing that I hope everyone else had. You can’t trust anyone that has any kind of position that deals with legal issues, politicians, school superintendents, seed company owners, Sherriffs, etc, etc etc. If you don’t think DUI Chris Elliott is not a true scumbag, just remember that orange Beach Mayor Tony Kennon, Gulf Shores Mayor Robert Craft (which has literally lost his mind and used to be a good Christian person) and sorry ass Jeff Boyd all sold us down the river with a no good sorry SOB drunk DUI Chri Elliott. What the F?  All these people counted on all you dumbass Baldwin County citizens to not vote someone who is already bought and paid for by these people and those in Montgomery. You didn’t vote him out so he’s your sleazy prick. Deal with Elliott. It will not be long before you will see the evil deeds that have manifested into a terrible problem that it shows the world how stupid Alabama has always been and even more, Baldwin County is the joke County of Alabama.
