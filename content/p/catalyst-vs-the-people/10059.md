 The whole truth is that if Catalyst becomes Mayor, Fairhope will immediately degrade from it's present financial Position, quality of life and property values will suffer. Catalyst will also give the triangle property to a conservation easement to manage and control but the city will still own it. That property cost taxpayers 11.25 million. The council will be in control of the 3B's, who all are corrupt.
