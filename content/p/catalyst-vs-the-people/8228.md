 Joe Davis and Ball were vetted by Catalyst during the 2016 elections.  They both ran against good people that wanted to control the out of control growth.
Ball ran against Frank Burt.  Burt ticked off Catalyst and Catalyst put in place Ball.
Joe Davis quit the Daphne Council because his the DISC project did not go through at first.  Catalyst knew that Davis cannot say no to a developer regardless of what the "project" is.  Davis ran against Lake and Lake wanted to control the growth a bit.  Catalyst recruited Davis to defeat Lake.  There was big money in this race but Cox was willing to pay big money so he could keep throwing up overpriced houses and make even bigger money.
See Baldwin County?  The developers are raping Baldwin County.
