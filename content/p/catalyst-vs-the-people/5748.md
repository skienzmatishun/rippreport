 When is everyone in Baldwin County going to realize that it’s just not the politicians that are screwing us, it’s developers, attorneys, non-profit organizations, School Board Members (some), Superintendent, judges (some) etc, etc, etc!!!!! Wake up. These people don’t care about us. They just care about what’s going into their pockets and how much power they can hold. Corte, you Fu&amp;k yourself. You are the worse of them all. Trip Pittman, you are a prime example of people finally waking up. You got 7% of the votes when you ran for US Senate. Now we just need to make sure we have some follow you down the shit hole of sorryass politicians!
