 So what accomplishments can this council claim other than putting the city in debt with by buying a field in a back room deal and voting themselves a Cadillac insurance policy?
The water shortage we are experiencing is not due to a busted pipe.   They have allowed all those houses to be built and did not dig another watt well to save money.

This council is, as Trump would say, a disaster!
