 Sherry was not in charge of utilities and did not cover up anything. And I also have to wonder why you expect an employee who was fired and settled a lawsuit has anything to explain to the citizens. If you are no longer a public figure, then why would you? The council or mayor could have explained but I’m a sure that was discouraged by the attorneys.
