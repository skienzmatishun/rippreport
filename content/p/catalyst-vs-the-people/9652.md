 It’s the truth.  Fairhope Employees are 100 percent behind Mayor Wilson.  When Sherry was in a position of power she abused it.  Not only did she take from the taxpayers wallet, she hired her friends in positions and gave unmerited raises.  Her best interest is not the City of Fairhope.  Mayor Wilson has proven herself by digging Fairhope out of a financial hole, the hole dug by Kant and 
Sherry.  Sherry, next time you wonder why you were fired, you shouldn’t go around town M-Fing the boss.  Glad taxpayers could bail you out once again.  Crazy how someone can sue the City and then turn around and run for Mayor.
