 I would like so bad to send these two guys home.   They hare invaders.  They were hired by outside developers to let the developers over develop the county.  Now we have overcrowded schools, roads, beaches, and sewers.   We have more crime, more taxes, and more petty regulations.   All of this so that DR Jorton, Belaton, and Truland could get rich.
I see Tucker and Elliottâ€™s sources of money and I know who these two really work for.  People of Baldwin County must be made aware of what these people are doing
