Get ready, Fairhope Catalyst Council is making their move to capture the Fairhope general election. Everything and anything in Fairhope is connected to politics. I have said more than once that the major negative in Fairhope is the politics.

Last week The Ripp Report was the only source of information that reported on the arrest of Ronan McSharry. In court the defense attorney made the incident political by raising questions about the Mayor. The Mayor had not one damn thing to do with the incident.

In question was why the accused wanted to speak with the Mayor and Police Chief about the incident. Why would the Mayor, any Mayor, refuse to speak to any citizen of the community, about any complaint?

The Fairhope City Council has bullied the Mayor at Council meetings and other public venues. The first council meetings of this council’s term, were disgraceful. The “leadership” of the bulling was…

The Fairhope Council has made no public statements about the continued bad acts and convictions of McSharry.

Another issue the Council has failed at, is making the complaints of former employees seem anything more than sour grapes and again political. The same employees are planning to run for office or will be support Catalyst candidates.

Today the phrase “to open Pandora’s box” means to perform an action that may seem small or innocent, but that turns out to have severely detrimental and far-reaching negative consequences.

Here comes the third sour grapes lawsuit and you better believe the Catalyst group has their dirty hands in on it. This article only covers one side of the story, the Catalyst side.

Former Fairhope Public Works Director Jennifer Fidler has filed a lawsuit against the City of Fairhope and Mayor Karin Wilson in her capacity as mayor and as an individual. The lawsuit stems from her …

Now the principal of the “alleged shaking incident” is taking her turn in court. The difference is, it’s Federal Court. The first two of the sour grape three, Sullivan and Pandora got their settlements from the City Council, uncontested. No City Council is going to settle a Federal Lawsuit. Do not be surprised if the case is dismissed, it should be.

According to a court filing earlier this month, Fairhope Mayor Karin Wilson is denying allegations by former Public Works Director Jennifer Fidler of wrongful termination, civil conspiracy, slander and other charges, and is seeking to have the case dismissed. In late February, Fidler filed a seven-count complaint in state court alleging she was wrongfully terminated …

In what was considered a political move by those attending,100 plus, the good Judge wanted to turn a family friendly organization into her own selected Board and exclude those serving. The Judge was knocked off her broomstick when people started booing her and then was soundly defeated by a 75% margin vote. This is a great organization and for one I am glad it did not get hijacked.

Like I said the worst thing about Fairhope is the politics. Let’s hope Fairhope stands strong, in 2020, against the Catalyst Council, and fresh new faces in the community, public servants, decide to run for Council positions.
