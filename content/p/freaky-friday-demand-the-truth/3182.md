 Ripp - you are being sexist by saying "until the fat lady sings"!!! Speaking of slander, you slander people all the time, actually, you are one of the most disliked people in Fairhope. Why don't you give something back to the city instead of trashing the city? You are not a citizen of the city that you seem to want to run, you do not pay taxes, you do not vote nor do you do any type of volunteering. You, Dean and the Mayor are the ones that keep this city divided. And you do not promote free speech, you purge remarks that you do not like and if you are really a 'reporter' then shouldn't you allow free speech on your blog! Shame on you!
