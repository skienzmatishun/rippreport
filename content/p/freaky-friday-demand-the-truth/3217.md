 Someone should go to jail for the SCAM they have pulled just on the Airport. With all the grants the city has received for the last 30 years. Add them up. No one has done that. C'mon Mr Ripp.  We should have a state of the art Airport. 
I challenge all the citizens that give a hoot drive down to the airport drive all the way around and tell me if you are getting your taxpayers money's worth!!
