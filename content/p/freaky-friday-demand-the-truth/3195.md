 The silent majority knows what's going on. Ripp as talking about corruption in Fairhope forever. What does he have to gain? He's not paid, he's not selling advertising, he isn't doing it for special interests.  Don't confuse not liking him  with the people who are truly self-serving: Council, Catalyst and Cliff.
