 Citizens of Fairhope should ask how does the Airport benefit the average taxpayer. 
We do need an Airport but at what cost?
I read somewhere that 24% of the City's budget goes to pay Airport debt. And the city doesn't have the deed. Is that even possible. 
If it is ...these politicians need to move on up to the Big  League. They would fit right in!!
