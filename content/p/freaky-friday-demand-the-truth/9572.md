 Robert Brown built the concession stands at the soccer field.
He built the arts center.
As a sh*tty council man.

And...he and the rest of the council (forced by Burrell) bought a piece of land
for $2.8 million and pocketed a nice kickback.

Then rented the land to a farmer after they told us it was for ball fields.

That, folks, is honest graft...BAMA style!!!

Woo wee Mister Ripp!!!!

Git you some if you can!!!
