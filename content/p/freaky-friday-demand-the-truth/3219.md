 Tell any potential buyers that they are asking too much if they want a working sewer system and/or clean water/stench-free air to breathe.  Tell them that Kant, Burrell &amp; Boone have provided them with a lovely flower clock reminiscent of Michael Jackson's Neverland, soccer fields, an amphitheater and that their tax dollars will support the airport, whether or not they have an airplane.  What more could any homebuyer (with or without children) want?    Burrell may have finally gone too far because actual media outlets are suddenly paying attention to this mess that he has engineered.
