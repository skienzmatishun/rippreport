 If you are going to lease it. Then let's first put the Airport property back in the City's name where it should be in the first place (yes folks, we've been paying several hundreds of thousands of dollars each and every year for many, many years)!  Or sell it to Jackass Burrell and his group with the agreement of the Entire Fairhope City Council's resignation. We can hopefully get a good price and save all this money that we spend (WASTE) annually, (Over 20% of the city's budget) this is stupid in the first place. Ridiculous if you ask me. Either way. It will be huge for Fairhope and we can make the city smell better Again especially the very raw stench that reaks from the city councilmen. Just saying.
