The Ripp Report is no longer operating as a non profit. It will operate as a cooperation in the future. The change allows The Ripp Report more latitude when it comes to endorsing and supporting candidates for office.

The Ethics Commission came through for the elected officials and the 1% who they represent.

A one page form letter that dismisses a 10 month investigation and hundreds of pages of documents. This is standard operating procedure for the Ethics Commission. No explanation just a simple statement “That their was not probable cause to believe”, that Burrell and Hix,”committed a violation of the Alabama Ethics Act”.

The Ethics commission also found the same thing in the BP Boom scandal involving Senator Trip Pittman. He was appointed by the Governor to be the “trustee” of BP funds. He entrusted himself with $750.000 dollars of municipal contracts. The Ethics Commission turned a blind eye.
