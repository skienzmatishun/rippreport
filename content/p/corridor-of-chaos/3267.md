 No one said Burrell stole millions of dollars. He did indeed make many decisions involving  millions of dollars, triangle, airport, sewer plant, the gift of wetlands and the soccer fields, over 50 million dollars! That was on his watch and millions got wasted or sub contracted to a select few. If you do not believe that then stop reading.What Burrell did at the Airport was illegal and he should be held accountable. As far as audit I agree and review the contractors and sub contractors as well as reviewing engineering costs.I have had several attorneys say that the issue related to searching computers, broke no laws or policy. So when I look at 50 million vs a he said she said they said situation, involving no money, then I do not see corruption. Many city's have the same practices.
