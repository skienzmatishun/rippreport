 Can we also talk about the Baldwin County Commissioners who will not respond to citizens who voted them in &amp; the fiasco at the roundabout on Gayfer Avenue &amp; County Road 13 that started on June &amp; was to be complete in 90 days which was September 8th.  September 8th came &amp; they were not probably less than 1/2 complete.   The FACT of the matter is - they are NOT working.  They have never worked a whole week &amp; sometimes it is several weeks &amp; they do NOTHING - how do they get by with this??  Who is overseeing this for the county??  Is is nsme Jason??  He is not doing his job either!!  Heard they asked for an extension to November - are the Commissioners that stupid???   They need to be voted out of office too - this shows what they are doing in the best interest of the citizens of Baldwin County - they do not care.  When is the next election???   If the County Commissioners have voted to extend them until November they are more than incompetent!!  It does not take that long to do road work &amp; a roundabout  - the citiaens are not stupid.  We need to protest &amp; they need to be working 24/7 to complete this project
