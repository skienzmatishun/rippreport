 If you are asking Ripp why the double standards, then you are agreeing with what he has blogged.  So let's hold anyone accountable for anything at all. Mayor, take a number. We have Jack Burrell in line first and then 3 Councilmen who (fact by the way) promised if they were to get elected?  They would vote "NO" on the Fly Creek Apartment Project. Funny how no one has disagreed with the timeline of the Fairhope Airport Authority. Maybe this blog is correct? We can't do anything about the corruption in Fairhope???  I would certainly hope that we can and will!
