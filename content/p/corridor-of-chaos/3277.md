 The City will need to issue bonds to come up with the required amount of money to fix the infrastructure.   We must do something to stop the airport payments so that we can show enough City income (w/o corresponding debt)  for our bonds to be rated highly enough to have a reasonable interest rate.
  We don't need yo subsidize the airport......we DO need a working sewer system.  Someone else will purchase/lease the airport land.  It is not as if the airport is going to go away.  The taxpayers have simply been set up as stooges to pay for (in my opinion) kickbacks and favors going to the political 'elite'. 
Anonymous 1970 is totally correct and seems to have a healthy knowledge of the history of this debacle......please listen to him/her!
