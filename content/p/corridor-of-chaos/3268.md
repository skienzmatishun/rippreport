 OK I get it. You want it done yesterday. Related to this is the fact that our growth has become a problem. At the last Council meeting they discussed impact fees and how we could charge 1% by state law. In 2007 they put a cap of $4184 on that so the McMansions don't have to pay 1% since that number has stayed the same for 10 years.
A lot can be done to legally slow down some of this stuff. This is an example. BTW the impact fees for commercial buildings has also been too low.  If we had a thoughtful state legislator they would get the 1% limit eliminated. The true impact cost in Montgomery is plenty lower than what it is in Fairhope. Another case of politicians failing to address an obvious problem. Let's see if the City will raise the impact fees now that everyone knows
They could/should.
