 LOL.......you are talking about a couple of thousand dollars that were never even charged to the City against tens of millions that Kant and Burrell misappropriated/stole just recently......if we ever get an audit of the Kant years, we will all be disgusted even more so than we are today!

If you, Bay Gazer, actually live on the Bay, I would think that you would care that your view is full of raw sewage b/c of the decisions made by Kant and the previous / current Council.  This leads me to believe that you probably don't even live in Fairhope, much less close to the Bay.  Paid comment or a Kant family member?
