 But hey, on the sewer money I don't think the money was wasted it's just that we need another 13 million to keep up. The little problem is they have waited too long to start and the big problem will be if they try to get by without doing all they need to do. The fact that they spent so much on Dyas  and soccer before continuing the sewer fix, that's a problem. We gotta borrow more money to fix this mess. All the bragging about paying down the debt last year didn't mean a thing .
