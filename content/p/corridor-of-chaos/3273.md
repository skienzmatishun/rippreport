 At this point in time it is terrible to try and think of a politician that looks to do the right thing. No matter what political position you look at. There is a lot more wrong than there is right. Some are even scared to say what's on there mains because they don't want to lose a vote or two. Tell like it is politicians. Within a few years, we will vote all of you out. Thanks Kay Ivey for distroying so many dreams of so many Alabamians by screwing up the education PACT program to start off with. All of you need to be replaced and you will be.
