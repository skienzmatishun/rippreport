 Georgia - I do in fact live in Fairhope, and am not paid nor am I related to Mr. Kant.  Please show me your proof that Mr. Burrell misappropriated/stole millions of dollars?  And the amount makes it ok?  She only defrauded the hotel of $25K?  Whats the big deal?  She only used a few thousand of a police contract for her personal vendetta, what's the big deal? Get an audit done.  Prove your accusations. Then I'll be quiet.  But for this guy who professes to expose corruption to give the mayor a pass on all her misdeeds just begs the question "Why?".  Time to go sit at the end of my pier and finish my coffee.
