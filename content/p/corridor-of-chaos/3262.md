 Until the city begins to subsidize the Hotel as it does the airport, it's none of our business what has transpired between the Mayor and the Hotel.  Bay Gazer, keep your eye on the theft of funds from the utilities department and don't worry yourself with other peoples' personal problems.  We need our Mayor and Council to get to work to fix our infrastructure.
