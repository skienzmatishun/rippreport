 No, Anonymous, I am not agreeing with his blogging of these allegations.  I'm just asking why he ONLY makes allegations against the council?  Jack Burrell voted against the apartments, when it was time. The subsequent vote on extending their timeline was not for/or against the project, it just would have opened us up to a lawsuit if it was denied. But I have devoted more than enough time this fictional storytelling.  Bye!
