 Hey truth teller - it is unzoned and remains unzoned so that the developers can put anything they want WHEN they want.  A department store brings in traffic of shoppers - not hundreds of people packed in shoe boxes that will overwhelm schools, and utilities like apartments.  But you don't care, you already have your home picked out somewhere nice and could care less if you junk up this area at our cost.  Hypocrites.
You must be one of those "farmers" owning "forest land" or "planting crops" so you can pay little tax and speculate in the land and sell it to a developer.  But then again you may be a developer.  The Corte family were farmers until the greedy brothers took over.  Now they are developers and to hell with the rest of the community.  I am sure their father would not be proud.
I typed this real slow so that you could understand it.  You Catalysts think that just because you fool some of the people you can fool ALL of the people.
