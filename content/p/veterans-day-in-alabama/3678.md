 Hey Georgia Orwell. Anything that you would like to complain about or bring to the surface during the past 40 years? It's was the Washington Post that posted the Roy Moore story first. Not the New York Times. If you been sexually harassed in the past 40 years. Now is the time to come forward. Get your facts straight.  Loser!!!  Read the damn news before you start your bitching!  Then you won't look as stupid as you do when you post something crazy. Facts!  They are easy to get especially about a story this old. Roy Moore is filing a law suit against the Washington Post. As you would say, "why isn't he filing it against the New York Times"  It's time for you to do some soul searching.
