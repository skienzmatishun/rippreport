 No words.......I am not a huge McCain lover after he saddle America with the very ignorant Sarah Palin (which is why he lost the election).

However, this poster must be the biggest loser on the planet!  The Roy Moore story was not brought to us by the very liberal NYT.  The Wash Post is the most balanced and fair reporting that we have remaining (LA Times, San Francisco Chronicle &amp; New York Times are too liberal and Fox News just makes it up as it goes).  

I hate that anyone in Fairhope could have posted such trash supporting a freak like Moore.
