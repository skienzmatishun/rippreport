 NONE!  Only his personal wars against a wonderful community with wonderful people wanting the best for their city and families. Burrell would have never been allowed to serve and as a veteran myself I feel so lucky that Burrell didn't serve. I'm afraid he would have killed one of us!  Traitors are not meant to be Veterans In the first place. I know his Farher or his wife's Father can't be a Veteran either or they both would have beat the hell out of Jack several times for the disrespect he shows not just women but all people. Don't think he hasn't sexually harassed someone. Certainly has done his share of harassing the hell out of everyone in this city!
