 Georgia, I think you are like Fox News. You make things up as you go. However, if you fact check Fox News, you will find that its reporting is truer than all of the rest put together and they don't slam our president with fake news every 10 minutes. If the Washington Post didn't have Trump to write about, it would be a paper full of Amazon ads. You seem to not bother showing just how goofy you are. You and Jeff Bezos are two peas in a pod. Time for you to get!
