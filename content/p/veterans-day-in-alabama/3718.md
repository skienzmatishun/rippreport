 I think that everyone deserves as much as a chance as anyone else. But, if Roy Moore cannot be consistent. He needs to go!!! I'm a Republican who had dug in for the long haul and have not been persuaded by any person whatsoever. If the people cannot get correct and consistent answers from Roy Moore. I'll say it again. Before Alabama kicks off at 11am on Sunday. He would be gone and a new game plan be already out in place. Whatever that may be???
