 Quite????  For the past 4 years you have known me but did not realize all the investigation work that I have been doing. I even have the Alabama Ethics's Commision runnning scared for the first time in 20 plus years. Be patient. I will announce who I am and what I'm doing for Fairhope VERY soon. I gave 2 of the councilmen a chance to do the right thing and not get trapped with the 3 devils. There is still a little time. But everyone in Fairhope will know just how terrible these 5 councilmen can be. God would not approve. I can promise you that. Guilty by association has been offered to 2 of them. They have chosen to bow to Jack Burrell. The man with the pointed tail and the red pitchfork! Amen!
