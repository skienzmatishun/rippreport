 I guess if your definition of "decent" is committing multi-year fraud against another business, throwing an employee under the bus, voter fraud, among many other things then I hope I'm not decent by your standards.  Folks are getting their boo boo feelings hurt when I speak the truth.  Go ask Mr. Lyons.  I'd like to hear him deny it.  Y'all just resort to name calling when I post facts.  Sticks and stones people.  Sticks and stones....
