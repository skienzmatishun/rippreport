 Hey Georgia Orwell,  why don't you call up the Washington Post and ask them who they think should be a good candidate. No one here in Fairhope wants your opinion anymore since you praised The Washington Post. There are a lot of smart people in Fairhope and one thing they know for sure is that you had no credibility to begin with. Maybe you can start writing for the Washington Post. You should at least apologize for putting out FAKE NEWS and saying that the Washington Post is best media source for info and that the New York Times first published the Roy Moore story when it was in fact the Washington Post who first broke the story. Next you will be saying that you were sexually harassed by Roy Moore also. Shut the F up!!!!
