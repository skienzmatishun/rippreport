 I agree. She does stand for Fake News no matter if you are for or totally against Moore. Georgia Orwell is illiterate since she said that the New York Times broke the story and that the Washington Post was a great source. You two need to hook up and understand how shit works in this world. 
1. Washington Post Sux and broke the Roy Moore story 
2.  They New York post sux some too, but didn't break the story
3.  I will agree on Roy Moore and his troubles. But if you cast a stone. Do it as a person who has never committed a sin. 
4. Those of you who cast a stone. There is only one that hasn't committed sin on this Earth. It's Jesus Christ for all you lost liberals.
