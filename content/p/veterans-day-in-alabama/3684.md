 I am as just as compassionate about Fairhope. It will all work out. The "hateful and cruel sinners" of this Fairhope will get theirs. This I promise everyone. The 5 monkeys that sit up there during each council meetings will be dealt with. Two of them have had a chance to improve and even distance themselves from some of the evils but chose to sign the same contract with the devil. I can assure you that all 5 of these assholes will go down and down and some of them who actually have a few good friends and a fine family will always be known as the sorry bunch that did their best to ruin Fairhope. ALL their friends and family members will be shown and will be reminded for the rest of their lives that they were part of 5 guys who should have burn in hell "yesterday"!
