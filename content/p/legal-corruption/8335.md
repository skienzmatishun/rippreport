 I have been skeptical of any far reaching Russian interference, but come on, it's not that hard to publish your comments on a timer.  1 am... on an old article... during the work week... during the work hours in Moscow. Seriously?  You are that lazy?  No wonder they pay you less. I'm just pointing out the obvious. So go to the next phrase on your list. I couldn't care less if pointing out the obvious makes me this or that.  The job market is tough out there, but stick to credit card theft, would you?
