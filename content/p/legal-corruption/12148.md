 Nice photo of Jack. Is that a current mug shot?
Mister Ripp I know Jack goes to church on the regular.
Sorta like MacSheri's.
But...if he sits in a bar--without drinking--that don't make him a drunk no more than him sitting in a garage makes him a car.
It's what he  does that makes him what he is.
And what he is is a slimy politician.
Thanks for pointing out this important, undeniable fact.
God help Fairhope, Alabama overcome this incrosion of greed.
