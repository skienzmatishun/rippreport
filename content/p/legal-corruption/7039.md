 Well I am getting in on this deal.   I may not get the $1,000 loafers but I will be happy with the $500 pair
These politicians are entrenched like concrete.   All they have to do is say “Christian” and “Conservative” and the voting sheep here in the county will vote for them.
They aren’t Christian or Conservative. They are just people here from Georgia passing through and making money.   They have played us for fools
