 People are moving to Fairhope because people are buying up those cheaply built houses that Catalyst developers are throwing up.  Now the homebuyers are realizing that they bought shoddy houses and are suing those developers that bankrolled the politicians.
See, "Catalyst Proud," how easy that was to answer?   You guys try to stick in a troll message to try to save your greedy behinds, but your statements are so weak that they can get shot down.  You Catalysts are so transparent.  It all comes down to greed that control you folks.  You are not even from this area yet you swoop in like a child predator, destroy the area, overbuild, and when you are done you all go somewhere else to destroy.   I knew that some of you got run out of Florida a few years back because they were on to you.  Too bad, the people here were too trusting.  But the people are catching on.  Your profits will be sued out of your pockets by the homebuyers you bilked, your politicians will be indicted for corruption, and then you will be run out of town.
