I’m Harry Still and I want to restore your faith in Alabama justice by serving as your Attorney General.

I am a practical Republican not a Washington D.C. fundraiser. My home is here and I share it with all of you, my neighbors. I want to protect you from violent crime by keeping criminals locked up in Alabama prisons, not walking the streets in exchange for a few dollars or freed by federal oversight. I have waged a tireless fight against corruption in Alabama my entire adult life. I’ve never served a special interest group. For three decades, I have been serving you from the hallways of your city and county governments and in many of the Courthouses throughout Alabama.

From earning my Eagle Scout to graduating from Auburn University, Troy State University and the Birmingham School of Law all of my journeys have been down Alabama roads. My faith, my values and my family are all part of this amazing landscape we call home. I will not silently focus on the historic past of Alabama - instead, I choose to move forward protecting you and the future of our home.

I would appreciate your vote on May 24th in the Republican Primary.
