 With all the money being thrown at Elliot and his campaign, I wonder if the voters will see through it.   Elliott has made many powerful friends and has many beholding to him in the political connections he has built.   I hope I am wrong but too many people have moved into Baldwin County, bought houses, and are paying big mortgages to his real estate buddies.
Just look at the last primary election results.  The number of the undervotes show that too many people don’t know and don’t care. 
I hope the runoffs on July 17 prove me wrong.
