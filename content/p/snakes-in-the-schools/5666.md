 Eddie Tyler has been engaged with the Catalyst and shoving promises that he can’t up the butts of principles and school teachers and promoting that DUI Chris Elliott as the right man for the job. News flash, keep it up Eddie Tyler, The Good Citizens of Baldwin County can get anybody in the Country to run this school system.
