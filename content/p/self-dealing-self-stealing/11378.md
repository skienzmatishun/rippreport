Alabama is not stuck in the 1950â€™s. Rest assured, Alabama is indeed in 2021.   The people running Alabama know that the voters want to go back to the days of Mayberry.  Because of this, they use modern marketing tricks to get the voters to vote for them while they steal the future.   Get the voters to focus on the good ole days while their future is being robbed
God, Christian conservatism, guns, anti liberalism gets Alabama voters in a trance and they will vote for these politicians
This is what Catalyst does and it works
