The state of Alabama is number one in the nation for political corruption. The Alabama Ethics Commission is the main reason for our infamous reputation for corruption.

The below article should be read by every citizen in Alabama. Stay silent, stay corrupt.

Self Dealing is the same as self stealing. Mr. Albritton children got more scholarship money than the relatives of Mabel Amos. What can you do?

Make a phone call to Ethics Commission (334) 242-2997, Regions Bank (251) 210-3640, The Bar Association (334) 269-1515 or [Attorney General](https://www.alabamaag.gov/consumercomplaint).

Write a letter call the TV and Radio stations and ask why they are not covering the self dealing self stealing, Mr Tom Albritton, Director of the Alabama Ethics Commission.
