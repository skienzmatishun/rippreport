 I found which poll the political hack was likely referencing. It's the poll from April.

https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/april_2021/election_integrity_62_don_t_think_voter_id_laws_discriminate

51% with a margin of error of  -3%. So a slight majority if accurate.

It's less than the majority now.  I really don't see how people have strong opinions about things they know nothing about.  Just say algorithm and clueless people think there is some room to stick extra code into something as simple as button pressed, add to candidate's linked to button's total. This isn't rocket science.  This isn't magic. This isn't wizardry.  Seriously, it's incredible how stupid you have to be so sure of yourself.
