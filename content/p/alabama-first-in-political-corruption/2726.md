 Here's my actual post.  Re-read it.  PLEASE. Because if we have a major storm, she just cost the city around $115,000, that’s why he was upset. Not to mention her not telling the council they still had an option for another year on the existing contract, which made this a big waste of time. Except for the fact that Jack hit the nail on the head, she wanted Pittman out. But hey, fresh eyes. Everyone gets a chance. Especially if you helped her get elected….Doesn’t matter HOW much it costs us CITIZENS…
