 We now know why the Alabama Lottery excluded “Education”!  Because of all the Money and Business that is going to be lost because of this Abortion Bill being passed by the white faternity of Alabama politicians. There will also be an incredible amount of money spent having to defend this ridiculous bill which steps on all of our great women in Alabama no matter what the decision of the US Supreme Court decides. Thanks again Alabama Politicians. Once again everyone else in the Country is laughing at us!
