 Nothing will be done. His dad is a federal judge and his brother works for the state attorney generals office. And this is a family that needed money to fund their kids education which could’ve gone to families of smart kids who couldn’t afford it?? My kids have student loans that are going to shoulder them for the rest of their lives and I try to help them out the best way I could. His kids go to school for free on the scholarship that the foundation board he served on award of them. So disgusting. The family should get involved and there should be a civil suit to get this money back if nothing criminal ever happens which probably won’t. The system is screwed and so our we.
