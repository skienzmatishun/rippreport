 We got rid of Tripp Pittman and now it's our turn to get rid of Luther Strange. Both are the same. Strange is not running on anything that he has accomplished and is only bashsing Roy Moore. Luther Strange is absolutely the worse candidate though there is little to choose from. I'm sick and tired of our current politicians at all levels lying to our faces each and every day. There is NOT one of them who do not lie. Moore will beat Strange and that's okay. Time to start thinking about making sure Kay Ivey hits the dang road too. She is absolutely the worse out of all of them. She has destroyed many dreams of Alamaba kids going to college by screwing them out the money she promised to provide to those who even completed all their education pact payments. Alabama is so screwed up. But heck, just look around. We have so many sorry ass people living here that the good ones are stepped on each day. Time to get rid of bad politicians and bad people who support them. Don't vote bad people in and refuse to do business with bad people and the companies they have. Just ask Pittman how it's going. It's easy to do.
