 Truth Teller. I was at the meeting where the debris contract was not awarded to Pittman and you said that it was because the Mayor didn't inform the council about putting it out for bid. The entire council and Pittman knew it months ago. THATS THE TRUTH! First lie you told. Also you said that the Mayor didn't want Pittman to have it at all. Well, you don't know that's a fact and I can assure you that both Jack Burrell and Tripp Pittman were both notified about the rebidding debris contact. If Pittman would have put in the bid at the price that he had an option for. He would have gotten it.  THATS THE TRUTH!! Your 2nd lie. Then you said the Mayor cost us another $100,000 plus (ONLY IF) a major storm hit us. Jack Burrell and Trip Pittman themselves will end up costing Fairhope the extra money because they forgot to rebid it. THATS THE TRUTH. That's lie #3. All that is written in this Post is nothing but the TRUTH!!!  That's 3 lies  off JUST ONE of your many post.
