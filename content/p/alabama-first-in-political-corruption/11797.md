 The State of Alabama is a strange place. I've never seen so many Christians fail to practice the teachings of Christ. It's the damndest things. I think the Ethics Commission leadership will have to reckon with God sooner or later. But they'll still go to church to show face. I fell sorry for how stupid everyone is to believe this is all okay and on the up and up. SMDH.
