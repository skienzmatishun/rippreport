 I always vote for Democrats at the state level and Republicans at the national level.
Bread an butter issues at home and defense at abroad 
Republicans  are great in the Congress but suck in the state legislature
Also this bipartisan mixture keeps things in balance
As a Republican I can say to my fellow Democrat Americans that I can see why you are Democrats.   I join you in your battle st the home level.   We may disagree at the national level but at the local level I will be at your side.
