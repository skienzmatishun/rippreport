 Ripp, 
The Alabama “Ethics” (cough) Commission is a joke.  As a state employee, I have to watch a computerized ethics course that this commission produces.   It takes over an hour to suffer through
Half the time I am laughing and the other time I am trying not to throw up.
This commission is a disgrace to the concept of ethics
As one of your readers put it, “The Alabama Ethics Commission  looks after ethics like a pimp looks after his hookers’ virginity.”
