 Thanks John Archibald for reinforcing what we had already figured out.  Now what???  No wonder Alabama has such a bad name and reputation!   The only way to change this state is for people to ban together and demand change however, makes you wonder just how many people left in this state that are NOT involved in corruption.  It appears that there is no such thing as ETHICS in the State of Alabama!!!
