 Ok, if you're telling the REAL truth, get your facts straight.  I said,  quoting Jack Burrell from the same meeting, that she didn't inform the council that they could extend the EXISTING contract for another year. So you mis-read what I ACTUALLY wrote. NO LIE there. Obviously the Mayor didn't want Pittman to have it, why else the re-bid? "Fresh eyes??"  Per the Lagniappe article Pittman stated that he received the re-bid documents in January, but was not aware that an extension of the existing one was an option, and that the re-bid docs were the only communication he had received (contradicts the mayor's statments in the meeting)  So NO LIE there. And they Mayor HAS cost us upwards of $100K IF, and ONLY IF, a SIMILAR storm hits. NO LIE. Pittman didn't "forget" to re-bid, he chose not to, and the Council was not informed that the extension was an option. Go back and re-read my posts. Better luck next time.
