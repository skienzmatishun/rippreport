 Jester Triple-Six. I agree and thank you. You actually gave me 12 minutes so I thank you. Sorry you think my Makers Mark is cheap. I guess you got me outclassed in posting and drinking. Is Orville Redenbacher's popcorn good enough for you? It's pretty goood!  Or is it cheap too cheap for your taste also?
