 Doug Jones was the best choice for Alabama in my opinion.

  Senator Shelby and Sandy Sessions (among many other Republican leaders) have worked so hard to make Alabama an attractive community for businesses/families to relocate to.  Roy Moore was the worst candidate ever to run for Senate and would have alienated the rest of the world from our state if he had won.  Even on this website, it was clear that Moore's supporters were a bit backward both in education and social skills.

Moore only won votes of the older and uneducated.  We must move forward; we need the young and educated to move here and locate their businesses and families.  

Alabama is moving forward finally!  Congrats to Doug Jones and to President Trump for admitting this and congratulating Senator Jones!
