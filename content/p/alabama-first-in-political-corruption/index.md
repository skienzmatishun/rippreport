You want to know why Alabama is first in political corruption and last in education? CORRUPTION,

Political Corruption.

Mike Hubbard the Former Speaker of the House was convicted of 12 felonies, THREE years ago and has not served one day in jail. He now is appealing to the Alabama Supreme Court, his defense is the laws “he help write” are to confusing.

The Alabama Ethics Commission is a joke and the Alabama Bar Association and Judicial Committee are known more for covering up offenses of Judges and Attorneys, than accountability. Complaints fall on deaf ears and the corruption festers.

A basic political ethic is that no elected official can use his elected office for personal gain. That is basic, yet in Alabama it is acceptable.

{{< socialpreview url="https://www.alreporter.com/2019/06/05/opinion-alabama-supreme-courts-solution-to-public-corruption-legalize-it/" >}}

If Mike Hubbard does not go to Jail, Alabama will maintain the U.S. Title as the Most Political Corrupt State and Education will share the title.
