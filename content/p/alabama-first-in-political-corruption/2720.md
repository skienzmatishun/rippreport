 It went on until 2010, over a period of nine years.  Check your math.  And statute of limitations doesn't start until the fraud is discovered by the victim, then they have 5 years to file suit/bring charges in the state of Alabama. So not really moot...But, to your point, the fact that something happens in the past means it's not important??  Fraud isn't fraud if it was 10 years ago (using your math).
