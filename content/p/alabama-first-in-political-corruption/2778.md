 Let me help you with the translation, since you may not be able to follow my little boy logic.  In Alabama, you vote based on where you RESIDE.  Not based on where you own property. Hence, renters can vote.  But, on the flip side, the own of the house in a town can't vote in that town, if they don't also reside in that town.  I see you're still sitting at your keyboard with fingers at the ready, just waiting to respond to my every post.  Do you have nothing better to do?  Isn't it almost time for your makers mark?
