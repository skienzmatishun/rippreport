 To quote Scott Adams, “Fairness is a concept developed so that idiots and children can participate in debates.”
So you are invoking fairness, Ripp?
Do I need to go any further on this?
Leave it alone.  Nothing to see here, just move along.
Here: drink this Koolaide.  Taste good, right?  Yum yum
Now, do you see it’s all good?
Ah yes,   the Commission is good.   Sheriff is good too
Have another drink of Koolaid
Now you forget why you raised so much hell
Now you want to just go and work in your garden.  See how big the corn is growing…..
