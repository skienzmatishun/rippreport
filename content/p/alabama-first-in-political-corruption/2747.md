 From what I have read/heard about Pittman's contract for the BP clean-up, it appears that Pittman is not reliable enough for us to depend upon him in case of a storm.  The BP contract apparently included about $65,000 for removing the anchors from the Bay; Pittman cut the lines, left the anchors in our Bay, and then he pocketed that cash for himself.  He knew that, with Kant in his back pocket, no one would do anything about it. 
Additionally, he does not plan to be here in the 'tractor'/whatever business for much longer so I doubt that he even wants the contract.......still, I wonder what is Jack's dog in this 'fight'?  As a Council Member, I would assume that Burrell would want to be certain that the clean-up company for a potential disaster would be making our clean-up its number one priority. If Trip is in DC, how can he accomplish this?
I'm not trying to criticize Pittman but would love an explanation of why Burrell went off the beams about this in a public meeting. 
I think that it is wonderful that it was put out for bidding again and that we have a dedicated disaster relief servicer under contract.  Pittman is not complaining.....he plans to move.....why is Jack so stressed out?
