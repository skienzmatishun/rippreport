 Hilarious to see Trip Pittman at the Roy Moore. While supporting Luther Strange for many years. Pittman is now sticking his nose up Moore's quester. My, My, better keep an eye on Moore and As always Trip Pittman. When I asked why he didn't carry more than 7% of the votes for the entire state of Alabama, he was embarrassed and walked away without any comment. Loser and a thief at his best. Duck Dynasty Dad was there. I'm sure Pittman didn't tell him about how he has mistreated, belittled, lied and cheated so many Baldwin County people. Disgraceful and disgusting!!!  Thought even Moore knew better. Hell, we are doomed either way. I love Oak Hollow. Hope they open the big doors at each end and air out all the stench.
