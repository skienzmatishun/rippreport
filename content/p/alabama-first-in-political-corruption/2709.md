 Jack speaks through his blog, Gulf Coast News Today.  What a poor excuse for a newspaper!  He is apparently still seething over his Bible buddy, Trip, not bidding on the debris removal contract.  If Jack can't give the contract to Trip, I guess he won't be getting a kickback from Trip this time.  What a pair of freeloaders.
