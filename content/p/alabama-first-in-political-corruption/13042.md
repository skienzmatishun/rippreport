 None - that's the whole point.  Alabama politicians are part of the good ole boys.  In Baldwin County, the Good Ole Boys are known as Catalyst/SCB.  Well, it was Catalyst until exposed Catalyst and the puppet masters who control Scott Boone made him change the name from Catalyst to Scott Boone Consulting.  This is why Ripp refers to Catalyst as Catalyst/SCB.
You see, Catalyst/SCB is really the developers funding the local politicians to allow such uncontrolled growth.  The developers make lots of money off of subdivisions and strip centers.  In turn, the developers give campaign money to the politicians.  The politicians are either owned by the developers or the politicians are actually the developers themselves like the Fairhope judge, the council members of Fairhope, the former mayor of Daphne, the state senator, certain members of the county commission.  i could go on and on but you can see the pattern.
Come election time, they play themselves off as Christian conservatives because the term polls well.  In reality, they are neither Christian nor conservative.  They love money and money is their god.  They are not conservative - they are just greedy.
