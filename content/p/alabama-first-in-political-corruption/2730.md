 Soccermomma, you are killing me here, you are being sarcastic right? It was funny how the community and economic director tried to explain her job, again. The question that needs to be answered is what has she done for this city? Nothing! I have said this once and I will say this again, Wayne was a great hire, he is strong. The mayor is big on ideas but has delivered bad press and legal claims. This is the mayor first elected office and will be her last. Most of us are shaking our heads trying to figure out wtf is she thinking.
