 Jester. I forgot to thank you for the drunkard remark. Please forgive me. I have finished my one drink and now grilling some steaks. I won't tell you that they are fillets from farm fresh in Robertsdale.  I'm sure you will top my beef choice too. Is that a clue?  You and Truth Teller actually keep me from having another drink. I dont want to miss the show!
