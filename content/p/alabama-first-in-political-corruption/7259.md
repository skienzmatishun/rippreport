 If the politicians care so much. Bout human life, then why don’t they help the children already born?  But no, their issue isn’t about human life, it is about controlling women.  I am s guy myself and I defer to the woman.
The politicians just want this to go to the Supreme Court.    There are other issues besides this exercise in baiting the radicals on BOTH sides.    Geez, even the nicest and rape clauses were removed from this bill by my fellow stupid white men who give the rest of us white guys a bad name.  
As Rodney King once said, “Can’t we all just get along?”
Hey my fellow Republicans:  You say you are for limited government but you are in the peoples’  bedrooms.   Keep at it and the Democrats will win back the legislature and then there will be SERIOUS hell to pay
