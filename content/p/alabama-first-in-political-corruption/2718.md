 Truth Teller. I am glad that you put "perhaps" in your last statement. Otherwise it would just have been another lie. You shouldn't worry about me. As long as you connect yourself to Jester. A lot of us are going to doubt anything you post.  Be your own person unless you and Jester have something going on together. If not? I would simply avoid posting with the intention that you are loyal to Jester Triple-Six. But hey, I'm certainly not the one that's going to give anyone on this site a suggestion. More like thinking out loud. I could even be on your side?
