 Governor, which after being the worst treasurer in the history of the state of Alabama, Kay Ivey doesnâ€™t deserve one single vote. The brainless Governor singing the new ethics bill is about the stupidest thing I have ever seen. Means Kay Ivey is just as much as a crook as any of them. Stupid move on her part. Shows her true colors. Sort of like giving Tripp Pittman control of some more BP money. What idiots we have to put up with!!!!!!!
