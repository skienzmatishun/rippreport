 It would be great if we could get a PRINTABLE list of Catalyst and of real people running in the next elections so that we all know who is running for which agenda.  Now that the weather is wonderful and everyone is out and about, we should print these lists so that Fairhope residents can read/talk/discuss.  We must stop these out of state developers b/4 they do here what they did to Destin/South Walton!
