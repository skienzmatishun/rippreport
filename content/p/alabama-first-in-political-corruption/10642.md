 A good leader would have sent people trained in diplomacy to quell the riots in the city.  People complain that BLM doesn't know what they want.  Trained professionals could have easily helped them decide what they want.  Make a few reforms that make sense and move money from one program to another better sounding one.  Congratulations, your cities aren't burning anymore. 

Instead, our president decided to go the other way and incite and antagonize.  And our cities burn.  What's your solution?  Kill them all?  Imprison millions?

There's nothing good about any riot.

Now address the attempted coup. Don't be blind to what has been arbitrary decided as "your side".
