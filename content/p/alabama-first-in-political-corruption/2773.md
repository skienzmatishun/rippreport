 Last time I checked. There was over $350,000 left in Trip Pittman's campaign account. I will be sure to hel everyone know how it's spent. I don't need anyone to help me do this. That's a good chunk of change. He should just make a commercial apologizing the all of us tax payers for screwing us out of all the money he did while being in the Alabama senate and to close out the commercial. Trip Pittman should be on his knees and asking God to forgive him for all the lies he has told God. He said on record that God told him he should run for US Senate. But God didn't tell him he wasn't going to win. It's like Trip Pittman who? And then you bring up the oil boom and the anchors he left in the bay and all the debri and heavy equipment contract that he has unethically  gotten and did a piss poor job handling them. I keep watching these US Senate commercials and they don't even mention Trip Pittman as even a candidate that is opposing them. Take the money and run the apology commercials. You still won't get 10% of the total votes. But you might get some forgiveness. Not!  Just buy you a boat or lot or something. You can be sure that I will know where it goes.
