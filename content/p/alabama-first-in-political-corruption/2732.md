 Frances, if this was not bid out, the contract would have remained in place at the same price as before for an additional year. They could have rejected the bids and the contract would have remained in place for one more year. While it is a hypothetical contract, if we did have a storm, and the cleanup as outlined in the contract will cost the city more money! Now, that is factual.
