 Catalyst politicians get money from people like Nathan Cox and the builders.   The candidates then pay Catalyst to rig their campaigns.  The politicians then pass laws to help the builders.   See the CATALYST TRIANGLE?   Wait until AFTER the elections and see thousands of dollars fly from the Catalyst politiciansâ€™ war chests to Catalyst.   Where did they get the money to pay?   From the builders and their PACs
Just look at the campaign spending reports.   The Catalyst candidates are each sitting on tens of thousands of dollars waiting to pay Catalyst AFTER the election.   This is done to keep Catalyst off the record during the election.   Just look at past elections and you will see what I am saying 
For 2,500 per month Catalyst will rig, uh I mean run, your campaign.   Where can you get the money?  Swear that you will sell your soul to Satan and Catalyst will hook you up with the builders like D R Horton, Truland, and Belaton.  You will get checks from them and individuals associated with them.  Look for a name of Cox in the donations part
