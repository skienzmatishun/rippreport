 No I tried to file a complaint against them, they were not happy, went nowhere they finally dismissed my complaint against Pittman. It was DISMISSED they refused to official rule on the complaint because the FBI had it and reported it to the Alabama Attorney general, where Luther Strange, Alabama Attorney General, Pittman's buddy failed to do his job.
