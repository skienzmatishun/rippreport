 Old news.......yes, they were wrong, but if you are correct that it was more than 10 years ago, get over it!  Move on....we need to take care of Fairhope.  The way that all of this was presented before made me believe that this was an on-going fraud.  I bet that admission and dues were almost nothing back then.  I was invited to join a few years ago when I moved here; upon inquiry, I discovered that membership/Initiation fees had increased from $5,000 to $15,000 in the year that I moved here.....I doubt that Lakewood will explore this. Get over it and let's get Fairhope cleaned up!
