 I am a REGISTERED card-carrying Republican at the national, state, and local level.   I am ashamed at what this Republican legislature has done.  I am voting Democrat next election for the state and county level.
You local Republicans have sucked off of the national platform and hijacked the party
The only way I see to treat this is to take the power away from you and cleanse the local party
