 To be more clear.  No, you can't.


1. No one's IP address is visible on here. No site would do that.  It serves no purpose.

2. An IP address alone cannot identify you.  You can get a court order for an IP address and At&t, Verizon, etc. can identify the location for the court.

3. This WordPress server is intentionally setup to not have any knowledge of your true IP address.  Even if the site were to be hacked, no true IP addresses are attached to any comments.
