 Liberal? Richard Shelby is ranting on making sure everyone knows that he is NOT voting for Roy Moore, the only Republican on the senate ballot. Well, heck Shelby, I have voted for you for years, been a while though, and have just 2 questions for you and you or your publicist can answer them. 1. Do you really stand strong for and want to protect Alabama and MAINTAIN a republican in the open senate seat and have you ever sexually harassed, even maybe not realizing 
it at the time, someone while you have been in office. Never heard you say that "you haven't" while knocking Roy Moore!  But the question is out there. Different world out there all of a sudden. A Write in vote for someone who doesn't have a chance, not voting for the only Republican that has a chance, doesn't do a damn thing but prove that you are the Obama lover that I have always thought you were!
