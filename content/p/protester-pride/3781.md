 Well. I have been back and forth regarding what's right and what's wrong. It would really be great if Moore was elected and allegations not turn out to be true. But!  If any of these allegations were to be proven. Then God help Roy Moore. But again, I would not want to be Roy Moore, be elected and then have any unlawful allegations proven!  I think Jesus would pay us a visit the very next day. So Roy!  If any of this is true?  Get out before Satan sticks you himself!  If not true. Then do a good job and screw the liberals and the democrats. Hell, they give enough of my money away without asking me what I think?  Republicans of Alabama? And you know who you are. Make darn sure you act swiftly and with a sharp knife should any of this be proven true about Roy Moore. Dang it, I wish I knew for sure. But unlike the protesters, "really funny", really don't know what the truth is either.  They can't handle the truth. Thanks ole Jack Nicholson. Why hasn't more been done to try to have the truth proven???? Best "unanswered" question of the year!
