 The loss of quality of life is because the developers own the council.  The council members are in office to make a profit and not serve the people.  The people of Fairhope voted them in because the people either do not care, do not know, or are duped into believing the council are Christian conservatives.  Either way, the people of Fairhope deserve to lose their quality of life.  May Fairhope become like Airport Boulevard and University Boulevard in Mobile.
God gave you - the people of Fairhope - a beautiful place to hold in trust.  You squandered it and laid it to waste.  You elected a sham city government owned by liars and thieves who moved in here.  This current administration makes carpet baggers look like true saints.  At least the carpet baggers did not fake religion and politics.  For this, may you be cursed for taking a gift form God and destroying it.
