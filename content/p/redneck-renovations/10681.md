 Hey Ripp,
I have a great idea for one of your posts.  Why don't you explain the "Triangle Trade" of Developers and their money ===&gt; Politicians who are bought by developers =====&gt; who pay Catalyst/Scott Boone ====&gt; round up more developers

Drawing a picture of this as your picture and then explaining it to the readers would make it more clear to see how Baldwin County is being sold off.
