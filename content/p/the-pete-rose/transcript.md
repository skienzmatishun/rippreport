# Transcript

Jonathan Leach, a former Mobile Police Officer terminated in June 2024, faces a first-degree rape charge; the Mobile County DA confirms the alleged crime did not occur during duty, and the termination was unrelated to a Sheriff’s investigation. The conversation shifts to Pete Rose, banned from the Hall of Fame for gambling, who bet on Reds games as a manager—using his best reliever only in high-bet scenarios—and regretted the fallout, calling it “dirty, dirty, dirty.” At 83, he remains a major figure despite not being enshrined, with more hits than Ty Cobb. Ryan Clesco hopes for posthumous Hall of Fame entry and recalls the Braves’ playoff run, noting the Padres won Game 1, while highlighting Alabama’s lack of local baseball expertise. A photo of new sheriff’s equipment—featuring a 7.62 belt-fed machine gun—is met with skepticism; MS-13 is not active in the region, and a single individual with a prison tattoo does not prove gang presence. Drug trafficking in Alabama has shifted from rural, beach-based marijuana and cocaine smuggling to a cartel-driven model involving fentanyl and Chinese-manufactured drugs. A Biden administration initiative relocated 56 Haitians to Baldwin County, deemed a “non-issue” despite scrutiny. Hurricane Helen dumped 20 trillion gallons of rain, with 24 inches in 24 hours in some areas, causing over 128 deaths, $25 billion in damage, and $75 billion in economic losses; a 7 PM–7 AM curfew prevented looting, and the storm is rated a one in 1,000-year event. Following Israel’s bombing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, Iran retaliated with 900 missiles (initially reported as 100), triggering a one in a thousand-year escalation; Biden warns against Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, fearing nuclear retaliation. UK Prime Minister backed Israel, raising concerns over disproportionate force. Longshoremen are on strike, with a prolonged shutdown risking halted Hyundai production in Montgomery due to foreign part shortages. Port container backlogs—especially refrigerated shipments from Peru, Vietnam, and China—cause delays; customers warned to remove refrigerated containers by Monday. The vice presidential debate was called a draw, with Wes Moore notably charismatic and outperforming expectations. Alabama Veterans Affairs Commissioner resigned after a $7 million ethics complaint over disputed veteran funds; Admiral Kent Davis also resigned before a board meeting. The funds were redirected after concerns over John Kilpatrick’s rehab, with Davis refusing to resign; a governor’s office staffer soliciting board votes was deemed unethical. Davis ultimately resigned, Kilpatrick removed from the State Board, and finance department cancellation rules (30–60 days’ notice) sparked concern. The Bayway Project, originally budgeted $600–$900 million, now costs $2.8–$3.5 billion, with $675 million in state and federal funds, a $2.5 billion gap. Hurricane Elaine disrupted timelines, with a Pearl River bridge collapse delaying progress. A proposed 215-foot, six-lane bridge with $250 tolls for cars and $18 for trucks faces uncertain funding and is deemed unprofitable without widespread use. In Fairhope, a $6,500 city-funded and $11,000 donated feasibility study assesses relocating the Montrose Hermit’s house, less than a half-mile from city center. Councilman Kevin Boone raises concerns about future real estate deals. In Baldwin County, Florida, suicide was the leading cause of death for ages 13–65 until August, when drug overdose took over, indicating a deep drug crisis. The area is a key trafficking corridor with MS-13, Bandido, Vagos, and Hells Angels active across Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. Mexican fentanyl shipments are diluted to 10% due to cartel concerns. In North Carolina, storm damage from Hurricane Frederick (1979) influences voter behavior, with residents focused on FEMA aid. Trump is predicted to win key states—NC, GA, AZ, PA, WI—on a one-point lead. The host announces a surprise trip to Orange Beach for Freedom Fest, replacing the shrimp festival with a "plague-themed" event, returning next weekend. A $10,000 reward is offered for info on Danny Williams’ 2022 death in Perdita Pass; a $100,000 reward is for the four shooters in the Birmingham shooting (21 injured). The speaker recalls the 1970s redevelopment of Five Points, where five roads intersect, and helped build businesses like Highlands and Chafon Fon, now thriving. A violent shooting at Five Points left over 100 casings, indicating automatic fire, not a single pistol; investigators believe shooters were hired from out of town. The incident lasted five to six seconds, making a handgun implausible; multiple automatic weapons likely used. A fire department response and brief standoff occurred, one person hospitalized. Access to the north side was blocked to contain the situation. A phone call alerted authorities to a man jumping overboard; police and a helicopter responded, but the person claimed no one had jumped. The driver, who had been in the water, was retrieved; the speaker claims no medical help was needed. The speaker recalls a boat trip with a Mobile friend returning after drinking 10–12 "white calls"; the man allegedly knocked both unconscious, threw them into water, and jumped off. Neighbors saw the man hit the woman, circle for 15 minutes, then jump off—believing she was dead. The sister confirmed the incident; the speaker denies letting the man drown, clarifying he ordered the boat to retrieve him. The brother, Tony, accused the speaker of letting him drown; the speaker denies this, confirming a call and immediate retrieval.
