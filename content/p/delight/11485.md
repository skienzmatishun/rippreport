 While I am Covid-fatigued, I did get the vaccination - not for me because I am pretty tough.  But I did not want to give Covid to others.
For those that did not get the vaccine, please think of others if not yourself.  This delta variant is a mean variant. 
Right now Iâ€™ve 98% of those hospitalized are people that did not get vaccinated.   What else has to hit you upside your head to tell you to get vaccinated?
I have seen three people get Covid in a week.  They all have problems breathing now.
