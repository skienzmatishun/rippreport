The current Fairhope City Council is the most corrupt and inept council to ever serve Fairhope. Yet people get riled up over a curfew meant to mitigate a virus that we know little about.

A curfew, 10pm to 5am, adopted across the state, including Mobile.

{{< socialpreview url="https://rippreport.com/p/criminal-enterprise/" >}}

This council has cost Fairhope millions of dollars and made mistake after mistake with Burrell being at the helm.

The council raises the flag of civil liberties while the same council wound up in Federal Court for refusing to let a USMC combat veteran speak at a council meeting, they lost.

{{< socialpreview url="https://rippreport.com/p/loser/" >}}

The same council who paid council President Burrell’s attorney fees every time they needed to extract his foot from his mouth. The same Burrell who used taxpayer money to derail allegations of his involvement in bid-rigging while he served on the Airport Board.

Burrell used the Airport Authority and your tax dollars to hire lawyers to investigate the whistle blower and then never supplied any report.

The same council president that has a police record with two sealed juvenile charges that he never exposed prior to the last election.

Councilman Brown has enjoyed lucrative contracts he acquired by using his elected position for personal gain.

Brown has a pending complaint on the desk of Alabama Attorney General. To review the entire complaint go to Backstory Podcast under documents.

Council Boone has more LLC's than a red head has freckles.

{{< socialpreview url="https://rippreport.com/p/investigative-reporting-business-entity-records/" >}}

Please remember Scott Boone is Kevin Boone’s son who runs CATALYST. This family connection has fueled CATALYST attempt to political control Fairhope and Baldwin County.

{{< socialpreview url="https://rippreport.com/p/conflict-of-interest/" >}}

The three B's spent 2.65 million for recreation land that "only they" wanted then leased it for 9 thousand a year for farmland. The city's first analysis of budget cuts, due to coronavirus, is $2.65 million, let that sink in.

The council has politicized coronavirus, to distract you. Some take the bait, hook, line and sinker. All this under your nose and the curfew has you pissed off, not the corruption.

This council voted themselves a raise and FULL FAMILY insurance that none of our city employees enjoy.

You want to get really pissed off or on?

What to know what has, and is, happening in real time? Read the Rippreport.com.

Go back to 2016 and read forward month by month and read just how this CATALYST council has represented Fairhope.

You now have time to read, those of you that do read, or you can grab your guns, praise God, condemn abortion, declare yourself a christian, ignore the virus and go to the beach.

But rest assured you are in very small selfish minority, if you do not understand the INTENT of the curfew.

This is a WORLDWIDE PANDEMIC.

Thank you Mayor and Councilman Conyers for being pro-active and putting citizens before politics.

It is better to be pissed off than pissed on!
