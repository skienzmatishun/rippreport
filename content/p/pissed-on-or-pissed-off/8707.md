 First time I have posted. I moved from Chicago here five years ago. Have a cousin here and she has a Big place so I stay with her and her older husband. 

I have heard a lot about the old man Nicks that used to run Things. I heard he is still around but not really in the picture. I heard he hand picked Kant and that was that. Kant always was his boy.

Along comes Ripp. Spoiled the party for the machine. Wilson got in there. She is similar to Trump. Trying to drain the Fairhope swamp.

Now, last election I voted basically how Ripp suggested.
Ripp backed Burrell and Brown and Boone I believe. 

Not this ho round. I see Ripp beating all five if they even run.

I had heard that old man Nix was in power so long because they always tampered with the vote and made sure their people won.

No more.
Good luck Ripp.
That land deal stinks to high hell!
Find out who got the money.
They hadto be a kickback somewhere. That's how Daley did it in Chi Town
