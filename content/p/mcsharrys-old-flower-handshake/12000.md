 Membership in Catalyst is the required vaccination for corruption. You must get it to live by  their development code. Keep fighting these bad actors. They are ruining the eastern shore. Look at the place. It is overcrowded, lacks infrastructure and the quality of life is being curbed daily by all the crap houses going up everywhere in the "county."  What a joke! This place is not equipped to manage growth when the judges and politicians are in bed together building massive subdivisions without impact fees and infrastructure. The big scare is coming.  Wait until the new high school is built. Kickbacks. Overt racism. Gerrymandering. All will be on display. hey Ripp who covers fairhope politics besides you? Yeah, there's your life quality. Alabama is 49 of 50. For a state with so many resources, it sure is lagging! I will step down and let somebody else tell me I'm wrong. Fairhope is screwed.
