Hats off to Councilman Conyers for speaking up for the citizens and encouraging Community Engagement aka Public participation. Mr Conyers is also the Councilman who has encourage the Council, unsuccessfully, to establish a pay grade for the position of Mayor, which has been in limbo since the election of Mayor Wilson. Mayor Wilson refused the duel salaries of Mayor and Utility Director, a position, and salary, the former Mayor enjoyed for over 10 years.

First off let’s set the record straight. The Baldwin County School Board has been wanting to sell the K1 center for over 10 years. The only buyer considered is the City of Fairhope. The point is the Council cannot beat it’s chest that they put together anything new, it was overdue. The Council had its own plan that failed.

Fairhope Council President fails, again. The Fairhope City Council rushed into a deal to obtain grant money to purchase the K-1 center. Council president Burrell would not consider any other options…

The Mayor had a back up plan and now the sale is on track again. The first effort by the council to determine the use of K-1 had restricted public participation. The Jack Plan went heads first into failure.

## POP UP TARGET

Jack Burrell is like a pop up target. He is involved in one controversy after the other. The newest “sketchy and secretive” project is the K-1 Center. I eluded to it in the last post under B.

The mayor is trying to maximize Community Engagement discussions for the K-1 Center, the Triangle property and the Comprehensive Land Use Plan.

## Important:

**TUESDAY APRIL 2nd @ 9:00AM A public meeting, Nix Center, will be held to select Training Facilitators, approximately 30, for 30 tables that will host the April 3 meeting. This is a training meeting that will prepare the Facilitators to guide the conversation on April 3.**

**PLEASE participate in discussing the best use of the K-1 Center. This decision should be decided by the citizens of the community, not 3 councilman.**

PLEASE check the City Of Fairhope for updates. [https://www.fairhopeal.gov/](https://www.fairhopeal.gov/)

The K-1 center, Nix Center and Fairhope Community Park, are included in the 4 million dollar purchase, no funds for development are currently budgeted for the K-1 Center.

The Triangle LAWSUIT SETTLEMENT was 8.25 million with an additional 3 million in legal fees.

Mr Burrell has always insisted the triangle property was purchased for a park, that is total BS. To pay for the property Mayor Can’t and President of the council Jack Burrell raided the utility fund for 3 million, and took a loan for the rest. The attorneys got their 3 million up front.

Keep in mind the City of Fairhope has under commission a Comprehensive Land Use Plan. The Mayor is promoting this under the banner of Community Engagement. The Council President does not think the Council needs “outsider input”.

Notice in the last 15 minutes of the video how Council President Burrell and Councilman Brown push for a conservation easement. Burrell and Brown know they can count on bee Boone, for that third Catalyst vote.

Councilman Conyers and Robinson favor the Community Engagement route, along with the Mayor.

Burrell, Boone and Brown all favor a Conservation Easement and they want to rush that decision before the Comprehensive Land use Plan is finished.

WHY because Catalyst does not want anything done on the property and a Conservation Easement will accomplish that. The Citizens of Fairhope better not let that happen.

President of the Fairhope Council famously said he was tired of hearing from the citizens, citizens, citizens. The CITIZENS better be sure Burrell gets the message.
