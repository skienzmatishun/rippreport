 All the building going up in the face of knowing better about it is what troubles.  The county has no guidance or management in building. They leave it all up to the jurisdictions and meddle little in county areas.  The result is you get a wild west approach to sub-urban planning.  I have been in Fairhope since 2001 and over 20 years it is sad to look at what has happened. Anybody in government should be ashamed. East of greeno is a travesty. Shameless politicians have no shame.
