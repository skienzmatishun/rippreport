Fairhope is at a crossroads and if the community allows Council President Jack Burrell to ban people from speaking during the city council meetings, at public participation, then we have chosen the wrong road.

Mr Burrell has orchestrated a campaign of obstructing the office of the Mayor from day one. He is complicit with leaking documents and fueling the Courier’s continued assault on the Mayor. He has convince the rest of the council to be in lockstep with his every move. His personal attacks on the Mayor are well documented and his rampage and revenge stem from an Ethics complaint the Mayor was required by law to file.

Mr. Burrell was certain that Mayor Kant was going to win reelection and that his mentor was going to crown him the next Mayor. The disappointment of their clever plan failing just fueled Mr Burrell’s assault on the Mayor and some female staff, he never complains about any men.

The elected council has accomplished nothing in 10 months except to obstruct the Mayor and her efforts to do her job. Not one major issue has been addressed since being elected. They have hitched their wagon with Mr. Burrell who has become a clone of Mayor Kant and worked against the best interests of it’s citizens.

This is about FREE SPEECH and the rule of law. If Mr Burrell is allowed to use his elected office as a weapon to silence others and deny them their constitutional rights, then we are not living in a democracy.

The City of Fairhope denied me the ability to speak at a public meeting three times, many years ago, and each time they had to recant their actions.

Mr Burrell is scared to death of any thing I may say on the record, particularly the Airport issues. The Mayor felt the City should hold title to the land since the Airport is subsidized by the city. Mr Burrell, the city’s liaison to the Airport Authority disagreed and fought hard to keep control of the title in the Authorities name, turning his back on the citizens best interest.

The Mayor has held her ground and has never wavered in support of the citizens, be it the Airport or Fly Creek or the sewer issues.

I am a combat veteran of Vietnam and a citizen of the United States and the Constitution affords me the right of Free Speech and some Jack Ass is not going to deny me that right.

I have filed a Verified Notice Of Claim To The City Of Fairhope:

Mr. Burrell approved Airport funds to hire an attorney to investigate The Ripp Report. He however led the charge to deny the Mayor the same right to legal consul.

So NOW you know the real Jack
