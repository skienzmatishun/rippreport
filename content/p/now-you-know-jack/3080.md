 Wow..... City Council Meetings surely are contentious. 
That Burrell fellow seems kinda stupid. But he did state  his threat correctly "speaking is a right not a privilege ". Uh uh I mean you know the other way around.  Duh 

This should motivate the citizens to come see for themselves the way these pompous "public servants" treat the people they serve. 

If he has a problem with the gentleman who approached the public microphone that shouldn't deny him his opportunity to speak. He is suppose to represent all the people 

...I'd say he proved he is afraid and angry
