 The Open Public Meetings Act does not require that citizens be allowed to participate and speak at council meetings (other than public hearings). That Act merely specifies that the public has a right to attend council meetings, except for executive sessions. It is up to the council to determine in their rules of procedure if and for how long citizens will be allowed to speak at council meetings.

Of course, most city councils do have a portion of the meeting set aside for citizen discussion and comment. However, even in that portion of the meeting, the citizens may be limited in the topics they are allowed to discuss and also limited as to how long they are allowed to talk. Remember the purpose of the council meeting is to conduct the city's business, it is not a public forum. Limiting public comment time in the meeting is not a violation of the first amendment.
