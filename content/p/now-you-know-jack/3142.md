 I do not doubt that one bit,Chuckee is going to get himself in very deep water. I am disappointed in Robert Brown who is a veteran and he sat on the council and said not one word, while jack refused to let me speak. In fact he thought it was funny, well we will see how funny
he thinks things are when Burrell and Boone take him down the drain. Freedom of Speech is not funny it is a constitutional right afforded to those who wish to participate in public participation. Fairhope adopted the policy and none other than Jack Burrell supported it.
