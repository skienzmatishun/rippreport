 Jack reminded me of Napoleon in 'Animal Farm' Monday night.  "All animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others."  Clearly, Jack believes that he is the most equal of all and the rest of the Council are beginning to resemble Snowball.....soon their faces will just blend into little pig faces (if they don't already when one looks at them).
