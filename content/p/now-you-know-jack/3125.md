 Read it again, some city's have a policy of public participation. Fairhope has an adopted, by council, olicy to allow 3 minutes for anyone to discuss any subject, weather you live in the city limits or outside the city limits but in 36532. I have spoken at numerous city council meetings and planning and zoning meetings in other cities and never been denied the right to speak.
