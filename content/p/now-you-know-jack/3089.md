 I disagree with what you wrote.  I think the issue is more about discriminating against one person only.  I feel confident the law does not allow the person preceding over the meeting to let some people say what they want while refusing to do the same for others.

And yes, there are rules about how long someone can speak.  Three minutes.  This though is purely at Jack's discretion.  If he likes you, you can talk on and on and on.  If he doesn't, it's as though he's flipped over a three-minute hourglass and he'll cut you off.

And since there clearly is PUBLIC PARTICIPATION, that means the public can participate.  Not just a few members of the public, but ALL of the public.  

The fact that Mr. Ripp was told he could not comment, during the part of the meeting that was open for comments, and in fact wasn't able to utter one word to indicate to Jack whether what he had to say had to do with city business or not, is clearly, well...not kosher.

(Not an attorney, I just have common sense.)
