 I have not met anyone, other than a few very old men, who would not support shooting Burrell tomorrow!  He has made a complete fool of himself (and, sadly, of Fairhope) in the past few months. What  a stooge.  Will Brown, Robinson &amp; Conyers man up or will they be forever relegated to Burrell's pitiful legacy?  

I know that Mayor Wilson is not perfect, but she is not a criminal. Since her election, we have finally been advised of the horrors of the Kant sewer legacy.  My bet is that Burrell, Boone and Kant pocketed a lot of this money for the so-called sewer upgrades, because now we know that the sewage plant is completely unequipped to handle even the current load and that Mayor Kant refused to fix the real problems.  Just keep planting those flowers.  
Anyone who supports Burrell better hope that their Fairhope/Point Clear property is a tiny bit of their portfolio!
