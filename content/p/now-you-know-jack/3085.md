 Burrell appears to be completely losing his composure lately; what is he so afraid of?  There must be dark secrets that he is terrified of becoming public; otherwise, why is he acting like such a mental case in Council meetings?  And why is the rest of the Council so cowed as to be afraid to make a sound that might set him off? I can see where Boone may have some legal issues to fear but Robinson and Conyers appear to be honest and fairly elected.  They need to grow some courage and stand up for Fairhope residents/voters.
