 I don't think that Jay Robinson or Jimmy Connors were looking for anything other than working to make a better city for their families and the City.  I would bet a lot that they had no inside knowledge of the bees and their pact with Corte to get the Fly Creek Apartments approved. I could be wrong, but (in my opinion) they played it like a master chess game with Burrell voting AGAINST the apartments so that he could get re-elected and then vote FOR the apartments  AFTER election when he had more up votes.  Then Brown ran on his 'my hometown' platform implying (or stating) that he would vote against the apartments;  Boone never wavered on behalf of his benefactor (to his credit, he admits that he hates Fairhope). My point is that Connors and Robinson are not liars and thieves.
