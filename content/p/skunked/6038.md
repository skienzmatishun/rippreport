 So if the Council decides (because it appears that they will make the decision) to make representation 'at-large' in the upcoming election, you are advising the voters to vote AGAINST the Manager/Council form of government?  That is surprising to me because we may never get this opportunity again to change the 'form' of government.  The bees will be gone at some point and the city will vote for districts, but this is becoming a hot button issue and people are saying that they are voting against anything that does not instantly provide districts.  Brown has a big following (for reasons I don't understand) and he is apparently advising voters that ANY change is a bad idea.  (I don't think that Boone has reported him yet for undue influence).  I understand that most of Fairhope is concentrated in a small area; however, that does not mean that elected members would not consider the entire city.  We certainly can't do worse than a few of our current Council members.....to the others, I apologize and applaud your attempt to calm the waters.
