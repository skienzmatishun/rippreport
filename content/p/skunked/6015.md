 Having individual districts would break up the control of Catalyst.   Right now Catalyst can influence a total electorate but if one breaks it up into neighborhoods then Catalyst cannot influence certain neighborhoods like the Fruit and Nuts, woodlands and Rock Creek.   
Catalystâ€™s weakness is running grass roots campaigns.   They are good at networking across real estate people, banks, and present government entities.
That is why a district form of government would hamper the Catalysts.
