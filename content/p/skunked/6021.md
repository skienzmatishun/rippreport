 I understand why you are fighting for district representation; however, I believe that it is a huge mistake to make the 'district v at-large' issue to cause voters to vote against the new Manager/Council form of government.  We will wind up with the same thing we have now if voters for the new form split in half over this issue.  The last thing that we need and can afford is for the serial liars (and we all know about the bees) to spin this their way and the voters refuse to endorse a necessary change.  Once we get the City Manager, the Council rep change will come.
