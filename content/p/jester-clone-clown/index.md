Many people have been following the Ripp Report and the comments made by Jester 666. During public participation of the Fairhope city Council I asked Mr. Robert Brown if he was the Jester, he said no. I then made a comparison to Mr. Brown’s letter,

{{< socialpreview url="https://rippreport.com/p/hate/" >}}

and that of the comments from the Jester 666, were the same subjects. Mr. Brown also took the time a couple of months ago, during a council meeting, to express his deep respect and loyalty to the Corte family and “former” Mayor Kant. This is fine, with the exception that Mr. Brown should not vote on any Corte project.

The Jester 666 made no comments during the work session or the council meeting, however the council meeting was adjourned shortly after 7 pm. Mr. Brown, Mr. Boone and Mr. Burrell were all spotted together at _Bone and Barrel_ restaurant immediately after the meeting. What do you think the three councilmen were talking about? Three councilpersons are not suppose to meet and discuss city business, then again they could have been talking about global warming! Right.

At 8:11 the Jester 666 posted:

> Did anyone notice that I never published that verse? “My hands are clenched in fists of rage”, not in a rage just want this site to stop bashing the council and calling them all crooks. I haven't called the mayor a crook, just point out issues and it gets to Paul then he goes ballistic. If he would take the same advice that placed in this ‘edition’ then it could all so civil. He could set some community standards about name calling but he doesn’t. Most, if not all of the post on here are based up hate, from everyone but then again, this report doesn’t post the previous post that I posted too. Either someone was calling the council members crooks, Bevis or butthead or some other name. So, you want the hate to stop then you Mr. Frances Paul Ripp has a chance to stop it. Stop others from posting name calling and saying folks are guilty of something before having being charged or tried. So, if Ripp will apologize for tieing Jester to Brown then Jester will stop posting. The right I will reserve is the right to post if someone starts the name calling again. BTW, did you get the answer you wanted tonight. I am going to contact the GCNs and see if they will meet me for a polygraph test, then you will see. You can keep playing detective but post responsibly. Deal Mr. Frances Paul Ripp? Here are the questions to ask, and to be answered: 1. Do you have any ties to a council member? NO 2. Do you have any ties to anyone that is tied to any council member? NO 3. Do you have any ties to anyone that is the city government or city employee or ex-employee? NO 4. Has anyone put you up to any of these post? NO 5. All of your knowledge has come from public sources, the deep web or otherwise. YES 6. Have you ever hacked into anyone’s system or computer to obtain information? NO 7. Was your purpose of posting on here is to stop all the name calling and finger pointing? YES. Any ties include but not limited to – any donations, talking on the phone to a council member, council person friend or any other person to encourage me to post, not related (that I know of) to any ex-employee, or current employee, etc. So, I think you need to stick to your agreement and pay me for showing that the ‘Report’ does not always publish facts!

I can see them now writing questions on a napkin, between drinks.

First of all, why would I agree with anything from GCN, Baldwin County’s fake and bias coupon paper? I am glad that the courier is not called the Fairhope Courier. The editor “chucky cheese” has been hanging around Beavis, Butthead and the Jester too long. He has investigated nothing and only produces hot air and smoke. He declined to look at anything related to Kant, Burrell the airport, soccer fields, sewer, or LLC Boone. He choose instead to ignore it. Chucky’s motivation for bias reporting about the mayor has come from the same sources trying to obstruct the mayor.

It sure is a coincidence that the Jester 666 posted right after the council meeting and referred to the details of the meeting. What is not a coincidence is that Mr Brown’s words, deeds and letters all reflect the same comments of the Jester 666. If Brown is not Jester 666, then he is a clone of the Jester 666, yet still a Jester, and thinks the same demented way. By the way Jester 666 I noticed you installed a little extra security on your phone. It’s working.

We will have to wait for Boone Burrell and Brown to be sworn in under oath in court, the day is coming, and see if they can keep their stories straight. Jester 666 is not fit to hold elected office.

THE CLOWN

Senator Tripp Pittman has moved up in the ranks as the worst politician elected to office, now that Kant is gone. Jack Burrell, his Bible study partner, is being mentored by Pittman, talk about birds of a feather! “Come fly with me Burrell” has voted, as council president, to award Pittman 4 separate municipal contracts.

The Senator was appointed the “TRUSTEE” of BP funds, and within days was plotting to skim 750,000 dollars on one of the first contracts let. Without a general contractors license, marine license or marine insurance or any experience, Fairhope gave the Senator Pittman’s tractor company the contract. A tractor company doing marine boom installation? The entire Ethics Complaint is listed:

He then fired those who reported the Ethics complaint,

Pittman then sought to save money and labor by leaving the boom anchors in the bay:

Senator Pittman showed no compassion for autism

Politics first.

Let’s not forget how Pittman helped sheriff Hoss Mack get reelected by establishing legislative conditions for running for sheriff in Baldwin County, only Baldwin County.

Our devoted Senator has used his position to enrich himself any way possible. He has maintained municipal contracts within his district, particularly Fairhope, where he is known as the established “low bidder”. State Senator Tripp Pittman is a disgrace to his office and his running for US Senate is a shinning example of what is wrong with Alabama Politics.
