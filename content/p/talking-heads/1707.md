 It will stop many to step up and serve, why would anyone subject themselves to this type of criticism! That is why we have the mayor we have, you wait and see, the best qualified will shy away from running. If not for this council, this city would be in shambles. This new economic development director, what economic development has she done? She is an overpaid PR person, she doesn't understand economics because all she has ever done is, well, nothing. I want to see the economic impact she has brought to Fairhope. I also want to see how much the Queen is spending on her travels.
