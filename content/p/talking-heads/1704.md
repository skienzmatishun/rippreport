 I am sure that you are correct in your comments but I have given up hope that anything will ever be proven and that any corrective action will ever take place.  
I had a thought that we have so many residents who are older and perhaps not internet news savvy... also, Fairhope's much-touted internet downtown seldom works, probably because Fairhope's mayor and Council do not want the voters to know about the sewage in the Bay, etc..
Could we possibly have the Ripp Report  &amp; the Fairhope Times printed and put into newspaper machines so that we can make our more 'disconnected via internet' residents read about the problems that Fairhope is experiencing?  I almost think that we are at the point of a 'knock on doors' approach and get everyone out to someplace like that amphitheater or whatever it is that has never been utilized and force the Council members and Mayor to address the 'citizens'?  
Fairhope has the potential to become what it used to be, but we need to force our city officials (to whom we pay a lot of money and benefits) to do what we want??????
This is becoming North Korea!  We need to force a visible confrontation among everyone involved!
