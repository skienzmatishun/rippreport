 I was told this and I have no reason to not believe it. But, I would bet there can be an a notorized advidavit from several individuals brought to a council meeting showing where 3 maybe even four Councilmen saying they would vote against the Fly Creek project if they got your vote and won a city council seat?  Why is this even still being discussed now in June if 2017?  Where there lies made?  Prove me wrong! How much would you place on this bet?
