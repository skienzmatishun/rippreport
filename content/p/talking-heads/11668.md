 No body, no administration had any organized withdrawal plan. They thought every body would just go to the airport, not expecting the Taliban overwhelming the county which caused the  government and armed forces to collapse. Making a peace and withdrawal agreement with the Taliban and not including the Afgan government eroded confidence in the government and Afgan armed forces lost combat moral largely because, without U.S. air support they would be overrun by Taliban. Bush gets credit for starting the whole mess, Obama was scared to withdraw  for fear of Radical takeover of Afghanistan, Trump met with Taliban reached agreement then handed the problem to Biden. Biden and the military leadership did not understand that the Taliban were  satisfied just to wait until withdrawal date. Biden also never forcasted the Taliban taking Kabul without firing a shot.20 years of mistakes, just like Vietnam we never learn.
