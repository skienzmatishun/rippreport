 Most people care, just not that many willing to take the time to actually do something about it, especially when your elected officials consistently ignore your concerns. This blog, for example, ask yourself how many people would be willing to take the time and money to keep this thing up and running. Agree with him or not, Ripp should be commended to making this forum available to discuss these topics.
