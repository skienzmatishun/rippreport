 Ok, here is proof that can be verified:  Haygood and Elliott once worked for Lynne Stacey in politics.  Lynne Stacey - and now his son- has been kingmakers in this area for the past 40 years.  Haygood came to this are with his two other buddies (Elliot and Tucker whatever his last name really is) and once they formed Catalyst, Haygood went from council member to mayor in less than eight years.  Elliot and Tucker literally jumped on the County Commission.  What is their REAL business?  Real estate of course!  They don't really CARE about serving "the people" - they just want to get inside tracks into making money off this area.  Subdivisions in Daphne were built by Tucker.  Tucker's involvement with the corporations located in Summerdale along with Baldwin County Sewer System just shows it. Haygood flips real estate.  No sooner was he mayor thane he built the Smoothie King and built an illegal road.  A former council member filed an ethics complaint but it was too late.  Elliot is right there in the middle with them.  
These are NOT meant to be personal attacks - just sad stories of how this area  has been RUINED by these.
