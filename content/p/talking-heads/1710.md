 LOL...the council makes about $1,000 a month for all the bs they have to deal with. The council members have a paying job outside of being a council member. Unlike the Queen that loves to spend our money!

I hate to break the news to you, there has been sewage in the bay for years, and years. 

It is like all cities, just asks all the Tallahassee Florida residents how much sewage flow down the Chattahoochee River when Atlanta flushes. 

I hope this is not new to you, have you been living under a rock!
