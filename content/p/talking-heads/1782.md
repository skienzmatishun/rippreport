 The first Mayor was forced out of office to avoid prosecution of Corruption, and Kant left you the mess you now have, infrastructure, sewage problems,needed renovations to rec. Center, nix center, golf course clubhouse plus more. plus fly creek, apartments, the 6 million in the soccer field and how about the Airport? I guess you think It is Mayor Wilson's Fault. Kant lost the first FAIR election in Fairhope, it would not matter who won the GOBS still would act like sore losers
