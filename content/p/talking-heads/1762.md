 It may or may not have been absentee voting - but compare Fairhope's election to Daphne's elections the very same day.  Daphne's elections were a joke.  The Daphne Council decided to shut all the precincts down except for the Civic Center to keep minorities from voting. Any political consultant will tell you that shutting local precincts discourages minority voters.  Anyway to answer your question, it seemed as if Karin's Atlanta-based political firm was smarter than the local Goober's firm in 2016.
