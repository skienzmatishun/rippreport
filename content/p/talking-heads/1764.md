 Kant may not have started out his life as a crook, but he certainly secured that reputation for good reason.

Karin Wilson is riding his coattails!  What an entitled moron.....we believed in her campaign lies and we voted for her. What did she do? She hired high school grads at MIT degree prices  to be her buddies.  It's pretty much all over for Queen Karin (as she has been crowned).  My heart breaks for Fairhope and for Karin's cute daughters.  I was so excited to campaign for her and I was thrilled when she won......I'm the idiot.....and so are you if you voted for her.  So sad but please don't punish her husband and daughters!
Their private life may be hell but it is not the 'citizens' business.
