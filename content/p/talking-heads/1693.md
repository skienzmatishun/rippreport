 Not sure what you can get signed but I bet you can't get 3 or 4 of the Councilmen to sign anything saying they didn't promise to vote No on the Fly Creek Apartments. Saw them on TV, articles and at fundraisers, all saying that they would vote "NO" regarding the Fly Creek Apartments if elected. They have made us all look stupid!  Liers!  Don't have to prove you wrong. We all saw it and heard it all personally. Can't answer why are we still talking about the Fly Creek Apartments. Before being elected we had more than enough votes promised if elected, and they were elected to crush the project and didn't. You can take that bet and deposit it right into the bank. It's a winner while we are still the losers of the Councilmen not delivering on their promises. If those stepped down that promised they would vote no regarding the Fly Creek Apartments. We might have one Councilman left. There's you two bets that you can win to start your weekend off and that's just the tip of the iceberg!!!  They should be impeached!!!  And the airport authority? It will be proven that unethical things have and still are taking place everyday!!!!
