 Fairhope is the fastest growing city in Alabama. 

Proves horrible mismanagement by the planning apparatus under Timothy Kant and his favourite son, one Jack Burrell.

Fairhope best wake up cuz things are quickly heading south in terms of livability and life quality. You can feel it. It's steadily slipping away.  Who will we blame among us for doing nothing to make a difference? Is Fairhope even worth fighting for? Is Ripp just nutso?
