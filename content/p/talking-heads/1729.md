 Actually, this is true.......she is just having a big ego weekend, but Kant had many of them (with Fidler at his side).  Karin is an idiot b/c she can't comprehend the optics of her foolish decisions (particularly with her two overpaid cult followers (Botop and Maser).    Actually, this may work to Fairhope's benefit because everyone is beginning to see that she is stupid.  That does not change the fact that I am thrilled that Kant is toast.  Karin was our ill thought out transition Mayor but we will elect a leader next time......perhaps Karin should think about this and maybe work for the city for a change. 

 Her chance to actually lead is right here......get rid of your drinking buddies on our payroll, start actually caring about Fairhope other than yourself, take a good hard look at our utilities, infrastructure, growth problems (all of those things that you campaigned for) and stop spending OUR money on Botop's trips (she's a moron and will never bring anything good to Fairhope) and your trips......you have no business at this conference......you should be here dealing with the sewer and apartment problems.  
I know that this sounds so mean and I am so sorry, but I am MAD!!
