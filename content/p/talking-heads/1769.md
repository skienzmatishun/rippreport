 Is mayor at this conference with Botop? I was at the council meeting and did not see Botop and the mayor sent her 'attorney' to represent her? What is this about. She wants the citizens to pay for her an attorney that will sue the city, if she sues the city then she is suing all of us. I think the mayor has lost her mind, she needs to take a hard look at how this looks and focus on the issues at hand. I have to say the council meeting was pleasant last night. No drama. I never thought I would say this but the council is our saving grace. Pray for Fairhope.
