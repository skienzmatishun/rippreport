 A lot of those that are in progress now, including the Fly Creek Apartments, were all approved by Mayor Kant's Planning Commission.  As I recall, there was only one member, Holly something, who voted against the apartments.  The rest of them appeared to be on Corte's payroll.  Now our current city council is letting it go through by blaming it all on the prior planning commission; they could stop it tomorrow but they won't.  All they care about is that they are probably getting paid to Not stop it and they can blame someone else. They are all spineless witless blights on humanity.
