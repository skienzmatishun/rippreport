 You are incorrect on all accounts. Queen Karin is cleaning up the books, the inappropriate spending, the corrupt voted for my buddies engineering firm etc. 
You, dear, are acting like a fool because your candidate lost. Why would anyone allow ONE PERSON to let the be ashamed of where they live. Shame on you. Fairhopians have been ashamed and appalled at Kant for over 16-years. He's finally out. Celebrations abound not just because Queen Karin won, but because Kant lost!  Take your corruption and your hate and move along. You dear are part of the problem.
