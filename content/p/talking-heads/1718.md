 I fly solo, so not a part of any group. I just tell it like it is, and all of the Queen's supporters can not handle the truth. I have all the time to post, it is really simple to use technology like a smartphone or other technology, you drop a line or two. It is called multitasking! 

Sloopy, sleazy and shady is the Queen's tactics by placing spyware only on 7 computers, an assault charge, the hiring of non-qualified friends, now that is Sloopy, sleazy and shady. The list goes on and on. 

"It is a shame to have to live around these people" Have you ever read The Ripp Report? That is all this is, bashing of those that are doing their best to make decisions that are right. All everyone does is bash them.

Here's is a question, why is it that the Queen doesn't get along with others that were born and raised here just like she was? Why is it that is seems that it is their fault when maybe the Queen needs to look herself in the mirror and stop her bs.
