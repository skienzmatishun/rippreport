 According to the US Census in 2010, Fairhope had 15,326 in population. And of the population, approximately 11,651 (74%) were old enough to vote. Now, using the US Census estimates for 2016, the city of Fairhope has an estimate of 19,421 population, and using the same percentages of voters (74%) this means there are a possible 14,372 voters. That means everyone over the age of 18 is registered to vote. 

According to the Fairhope website, in 2016 there 15,777 registered voters and of that only 6,625 voted (41.99%). If you use the above percentages, how can there be that many registered voters in 2016? 

Impossible! 

I wonder how many absentee ballots there were, and who voted for whom? Are there people on the voting rolls that need to be purged and are there people of the voting rolls that do not homestead in Fairhope or are registered to vote in two cities? If this is their second home, then they are allowed to vote but they need to be homestead, tags, taxes, ectara, etc. You can vote in national elections because the federal government does care, but the state and cities do care! 

Was it the absentee voting that won the mayor office in 2016? Hum....
