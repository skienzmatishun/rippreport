 Well, despite the attacks of 9/11/2001, what have we learned?
We dumped tons of money in Afghanistan, built two huge air bases, and left them to the Taliban along with tons of weapons and equipment.
What is more, the world is laughing at us.
Yeah, you can say Never forget," but what is there to remember?  Twenty years later we are still the laughing stock of the world, we are not anymore secure, and we are living in a police state.   Yep, I won't forget - I won't forget that after being attacked like we were, we STILL are making the same mistakes and still voting Democrat.
