 Indeed, yes indeed she has crowned herself queen, as so has her closest friends, and I am still laughing at the post on Facebook about the olive branch. She once again is blaming her action on how she was spoken to, and how the city attorney spoke to her. 

I wonder if she has ever recorded herself and then listen to it. For once, she needs to stand up like a leader, take action for what she did and then put it behind her, move forward. Nothing worse than a leader blaming someone else for their own actions. 

She truly reminds me of Clinton, Clinton stated today, "I take full responsibility for my defeat but if it had not been for Comey, WkiLeaks I would be president." lol
