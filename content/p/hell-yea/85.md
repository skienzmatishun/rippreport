 I disagree on the utility director choice, however agree with the remainder of your suggestions. I am a little apprehensive at what may be found with a though audit of the utilities. Kants decision to use 3 million from the utility fund to pay for a lawsuit settlement was a poor decision. Now we find out the infrastructure of the utilities is in dire need of 3 to 5 million?????
