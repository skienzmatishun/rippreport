 You can't really believe that without continuous growth Fairhope could not afford flowers and lights downtown. 
Not sure how long you have been around Fairhope but we have had Christmas lights and flowers downtown years before the uncontrolled growth. 

Keep the building moratorium in place for at least a year.
