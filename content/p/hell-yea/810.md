 The mayor did indeed make threats from the beginning, she made allegations against many of the council. The mayor did upset the apple cart, but upsetting the apple cart is not the goal, the goal is to lead, leaders become leaders by getting things done, not pointing fingers, not blaming everyone for what happened in the past, the past is the past and can not be changed, period. The mayor lack leadership skills, you may not want to hear this, and she may not want to hear this, but this is true. She needs to learn to shut up, listen and when she does speak, make a point then shut up. She needs to learn to lead, not cry, not go on social media and complain, just lead, lead from the front and take what she is given and proof she can get the job done. I have watched all of the council meetings, AND the WORK sessions, in the work sessions is where the mayor made her threats, the videos are there to view. I would not vote for her again for love or money, nor would I vote for a few of the council members again, either. ANYONE can point the finger, anyone, but it is what you get done that matters, not complaining, not having surrogates come to her rescue, she needs to stand on her own and learn to lead. Sorry guys.
