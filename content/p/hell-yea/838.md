 The Fly Creek issue is what put her in office, now we see a council with amnesia. The Airport Authority problem she inherited citizens came to her and reported wrongdoing&gt; What should she do? When government changes only once in 16 years you can count on the type push back we are seeing.At least you cannot buy her. The problem is some people do not want to change, I respect that but you cannot have the growth we are experiencing and not be a little progressive.
