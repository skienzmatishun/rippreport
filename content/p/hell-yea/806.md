 I totally agree.  Whoever is advising her is leading her over a cliff.  I voted for her and am still happy that she won, but I am not 'with' her on some of her current issues.  Botop was a major PR mistake on her part and she needs to get over it. Also, her press conferences about reducing city services b/c the Council has instituted a hiring freeze have been major mistakes.  She is the one who took months to present a budget; city services were not affected by the freeze b/c it affected so few positions, and she has alienated the Council to the point that I think they are continuing the apartments just to spite her.  Again, I am glad that she won, but if the election were held today I doubt that she would win again.   She needs to stop acting like the Queen and begin listening to the voters.  She appears to be in a self-imposed bubble of 'friends with agendas'.
