 I voted for her (as did many others, 500 more than voted for King Kant).  She has rewarded her supporters by crowning herself Queen.  Every time I hear her speak about how 'the citizens want Botop or whatever else', I want to tell her that, if I knew about this before the vote, I would never have voted for her……and I am probably one of the last 'Citizens' that I know who would not throw her out of office in a heartbeat!  She has become delusional…….sympathies to her adorable daughters and husband.
