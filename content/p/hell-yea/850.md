 The mayor made this statement "It's not personal, it's business." "But business is personal...and politics is too."

She needs to practice what she preaches, she is the one that has accused others of wrongdoing, but it is not personal to them?

Did it take this long to get this? You don't think the folks she has accused doesn't have a family too, their families hear their family members accused of wrongdoing....that it not hurtful?

The mayor needs to stand up, and apologize for all the accusations, then move forward. This requires leadership at the highest level and we'll see if she has what it takes.

If the mayor does what is right, then she will get my 110% support going forward. 

If she starts saying like she did on her facebook page "the president of the council told me to sit down the city attorney scolded me," but take full responsibility for what she did then I think she can become redeem herself. No one can make someone else to something, no one made her do anything, she did it on her own.

Pride is not a good thing in leadership, too much pride will destroy a leader. 
All leaders make mistakes, those that can apology for their mistakes, take ownership of their mistakes makes a great leader.

It will be interesting to see what she does...I don't think she has in her to take responsibility for her own actions. Too much pride...
