 It appears that the council for whatever reason was under the distinct impression that THEY and NOT the PEOPLE would determine at-large or districts. I watched the video from last week and a gentleman explained everything. The city was basing its assumption of at-large control on an outdated statute of Alabama revised law.  Unbeknownst to the council and their counsel in this matter (city attorney?) the law had been again revised.  The new law stipulated any government change be districts.  This was the council's mistake. They placed trust in their legal counsel.

This is a major blow to the local good ole boys. It was like Boone, Brown and Conyers went to play golf and came home and Jack and Jay were playing video games in diapers while someone came in and stole everything.  Jay is the attorney. He should have read the updated revised statute. He is not much of an attorney.

There are several reasons to vote FOR the initiative.

1) It works in Vestavia and Mountain Brook.
2) It will empower poor people of color to run for office in districts.  
3) It will end the reign of the machine in Fairhope and truly provide 


HOPE.
