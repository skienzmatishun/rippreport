 I have watched all the council work sessions and formal meeting now (whoo), and I have to say this, the mayor did indicate that she wanted this position and this would keep her from eliminating others from the payroll. And the mayor stated she already had someone in mind, the position was not created yet, nor was it posted but she already had been talking to Botop.

It is all sad, I really wished the mayor had not come into office with all the threats, it has been a disservice to all. Also, if I were the mayor, given her current issues, it would be very wise on her part to find new advisors because it is very clear that what she is currently doing is not working.

Lastly, I think the statement of it being an all-male council is going to backfire. The mayor really needs to take a hard look at new advice, perhaps someone that is not political and keeps a very low profile.
