 Fairhope first has a flyer going out to all Fairhope voters. I would think this thing is gonna pass if it goes to a vote. Hundreds of zunks punks...people who have lived here only a year or two...have already voted absentee! This is an outrage and a complete con job by zunk working with that non citizen trouble maker Paul Ripp.
This will be stopped in court. The locals will not allow this to happen. No vote on Tuesday is the early word. Wait for the stay.
