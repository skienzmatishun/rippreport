 I am very upset with the Council for prolonging the Fly Creek Apartment debacle; however, I agree with them that the 'new department' was a waste of Fairhope's money.  It appeared all along that Mrs. Botop was hired because of her friendship with the Mayor and she has been extremely overpaid.  Their DC jobs must not have been much if they both quit and moved here without even giving her new job a trial run.  The position should have been posted and then candidates interviewed.  I don't see anything in Mrs. Botop's experience that would qualify her as the best person for this type of job.
