 No, men are not threatened by highly intelligent women, my wife is highly intelligent and a professional and I am not threatened. When I was a CEO, I had more female executive officers than men, I hired the most qualified not based upon sex, race, etcetera, etc.

Who ever posted this is clearly sexist and short-sighted.
