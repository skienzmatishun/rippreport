 The Mayor did not come into office with threats.  Go back and watch the first four council meetings and you can see Burrell and Boone threw everything at  the Mayor except the kitchen sink. Has she made mistakes, yes, did she have a smooth transition into office, hell no they fought her starting the day after she won.  Issues like the airport lift station apartments soccer fields triangle lawsuit and the sewer plant all have issues. What is happening is those issues are rising to the surface because fresh eyes are looking at them. Mr Burrell and Mr Boone have a lot of baggage and they do not want anyone opening the bag. The Mayor upset the apple cart by winning.
