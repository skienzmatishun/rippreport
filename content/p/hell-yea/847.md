 I really can't wait until growth does stop, this budget will shrink like a pond in Alabama during the month of July. 

Donation for this, a donation for that will go away, and then everyone will come to understand how development helps a city's budget. Retail, retail, and retail will help build schools and roads.

If anyone understands anything about finance knows this, but no, everyone on this site knows everything about everything, gezzzz.
