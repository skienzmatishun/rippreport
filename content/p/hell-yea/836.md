 The problem is those impact fees, millions, ended up being used for attorneys and lawsuits not infrastructure. The triangle lawsuit cost us 11.25 million and  required a 3 million down payment which came from the electric  dept. that now needs 3 million of infrastructure work? Sewer ground lines and lift stations need million to upgrade system in order to get sewage to plant? In short the money collected was not spent on infrastructure or maintenance.
