The Ripp Report has written about the Baldwin County Mega-site numerous times. In May last year we had an update on it’s sales status, nothing new.

{{< socialpreview url="https://rippreport.com/p/economic-development-baldwin-county-style/" >}}

Then, in February, we got a little more serious about the coverage due to mid term elections. The commissioners should be held responsible and incumbents voted out over their failure to generate any interest in the Mega-site.

Now you would think the commissioners would be a little sensitive of all the critical comments. No way they are like ducks in water, just remain silent and most voters will not realize 32 million is in an undeveloped piece of land, cattle could not live on.

Then in January the commissioners and Baldwin County Economic Development Alliance announce they failed again in finding a tenant however the good news was that all the mega-site’s in the southeast have been sold. Fantastic, we are dead last so now we have a much better chance of development.

Now folks you would think the commissioners and those hot shot salesmen of the alliance would have a new and dynamic sale plan. Not a chance, presently there is NO SIGN at the mega site. The worst real estate salesperson in the world would at least maintain a sign on the property. Maybe they took it down due to overwhelming interest? Or maybe it rotted away and no one knows it! It was a rotten deal.

NO SIGN?

Just a cattle gate and a few palm trees.

I guess the instructions for a client to locate the site would read:

Mega- site for sale, no sign on property, just go north on highway 59 from Bay Minette and look for cattle gate and palm trees, before you get to I-65, Land no good for cattle, 700 hundred acres are not suitable for development, only 32 million bitcoin or cash, no refunds, contact:phone number on sign. Do not call commissioners.

But where would you put this information if there is NO SIGN????
