UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS [![United States Marine Corps](https://cdn.rippreport.com/5cb6007f-marine-logo.jpg)](https://cdn.rippreport.com/5cb6007f-marine-logo.jpg) The U.S. Marine Corps is celebrating its 246th birthday on Wednesday. The U.S. Marine Corps was founded during the American Revolution with the creation of two battalions of Continental Marines in Philadelphia on November 10th, 1775. We salute those who have served on this special day.

ONCE A MARINE ALWAYS A MARINE, 1966/1968, VIETNAM, THIRD MARINES, TET OFFENSIVE. A SALUTE TO ALL THOSE THAT SERVED, SOME THAT PAID THE ULTIMATE PRICE.

SEMPER FI
