 I hope that you are correct but I am afraid that the 'Christians' are still drinking the Burrell kool-aid.  Old people in Fairhope are convinced by their Church friends that Mayor Wilson is the source of all of the woes of their world.  (Women should stay home and keep their mouths shut, right?)   They will pop up to vote for Burrell again because be pastes on that phony smile and pretends to be concerned over their plights and they will probably die before they wise up and recognize that Mayor Kant and Jack Burrell caused most of their problems.  However, I remain hopeful that you are totally right!
