 Dear Georgia, 
You know that windmill and barn thing going up on 181 across from Old Field?  There is going to be over 900 houses going in there.  That means about an extra 1,500 more cars dumping out on 181 each day.  That means thousands of gallons of extra sewage to be dumped into Mobile Bay.
Just how much are the developers going to be allowed to continue to stress this place before the people say enough?  It sure wont be the politicians - they actually work for the developers and not the voters.
I guess the residents here deserve this with their apathy
