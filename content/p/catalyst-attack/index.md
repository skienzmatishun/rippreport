If you live in Baldwin County, please share this post as much as possible. This is very IMPORTANT.

[The Ripp Report](https://rippreport.com/), [Baldwin County Legal Eagle](https://www.facebook.com/BaldwinCountyLegalEagle/), [the Ripp Report Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/TheRippReport/) and [Backstory Podcast](https://www.facebook.com/BackstoryPodcast/) are NOT for profit consumer sites. Our intent is to inform the public of corruption, corrupt politicians and to address every day consumer issues.

Our sites do not delete, block, censor or alter comments based on your opinion. Beware of sites that do not practice Free Speech but promote CATALYST, delete posts and comments, and promote a one sided political picture, that of CATALYST. Political hacks of CATALYST and Catalyst candidates are like an “Old Shoe”, worn out.

CATALYST/Scott Boone Consulting is a profit making political group who represents the interests of developers. They select candidates to represent their interests, NOT that of the citizens of Baldwin County. In the upcoming elections of Fairhope, Daphne, Spanish Fort and Bay Minette, CATALYST has their hand picked candidates, that when selected, are obliged to follow the good ole boy creed which always ends in corruption.

Baldwin County tax payers are their victims.

Baldwin County has been under political siege by the good ole boys under numerous names. CATALYST was the name of choice until a few weeks ago, when a new name Scott Boone Consulting appeared. This was after CATALYST suffered a bitter defeat in the congressional race.

The CATALYST name had become infamous and so toxic in Baldwin County that the principal of Catalyst decided to change it to his own name, Scott Boone Consulting. Mr Boone is the son of Fairhope councilman Kevin Boone. Both Boone’s have been implicated in the land fraud known as “Strawman” featured in Lagniappe under series. Be sure to study the spider graph of CATALYST players.

That “SPIDER GRAPH” identifies people in one of the largest land fraud deals in Baldwin County. Scott is the money distributor, the bank, for CATALYST candidates. Where does the money come from? Over a million dollars so far, not counting the dark money passed under the table.

CATALYST/Scott Boone Consulting, CSB, is a threat to everyone's quality of life in Baldwin County. They represent the dirty ugly side of politics where Christianity is turned on it’s head for a vote.

WARNING: CATALYST/Scott B??ne Consulting, CSB, is a county wide threat. Fairhope, Daphne Spanish Fort and Bay Minette all have CSB candidates.

Do you hate the unbridled development? Lack of impact fees and a sewer system holding the county hostage?

Our schools busting at the seams?

That is CSB.

They are organized and represent money, not people. Do not be confused by signs. Identify CATALYST by studying the signs. CSB Candidates run in a block position supporting one another, this is obvious in Daphne and Fairhope, where all CATALYST candidates place their signs side by side.

Here is an accurate post from Daphne, explaining CATALYST and how to identify them.

Ole Towne Daphne | August 5, 2020 at 8:42 pm

Just look for the pvc signs If you want names then see for yourself on the Secretary of State website on campaign reports You Will see the donations from all the developers Prebble DR Horton Columbia Southern Truland Corte Cox They funnel money to the vetted politicians. Catalyst checks out and picks the politicians and signs them on then the developers fund the politicians and the politicians pay Catalyst. Like a Triangle Trade you read about in colonial times Catalyst then keeps the politicians in line. If an opposing candidate runs and seems to be a threat, Catalyst will threaten I knew a certain Catalyst tried to intimidate the cousin of an opponent. That Catalyst told the cousin “I represent every sitting just get in this county and you donot want to run against my client because you will lose and you will have to face a judge that I represent.” The opposing politician ran for Commissioner I know this because I was in politics Catalyst does better at running “at large”rather than at district levels. This keeps the votes diluted. Now do you see why the las t election for change in Fairhope’s government had just one voting booth outside of the city hall? It is for the same reason why Daphne closed the minority precincts in the 2016 election Catalyst is smart and stacks the deck

In 2018, CATALYST tried and failed to take over the entire county administration. From county commissioners to probate judge, they failed. They failed, but not totally. Many CATALYST, CSB, candidates were successful in getting elected.

CATALYST, CSB, lost to Jerry Carl in the congressional race last month. Now with a name change and the same shady antics that they are known for, CATALYST has it’s eyes on municipal races across the county.

With your help, share, share, share, we can expose and defeat a stigma of corruption that has stuck to Baldwin County like a blood sucking bat.
