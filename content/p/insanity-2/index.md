Alabama needs a psychiatrist and a financial advisor. The lives lost, hospitals closed and billions of dollars, left on the table, is the result of despicable political motives of several Alabama Republican Governors.

EXPAND MEDICAID, sounds simple, practical and in the best interest of all Alabama citizens. Only one obstacle Medicaid is part of the Affordable Care Act.

Let’s go back to Love Gov. Bentley in 2015 when he left 3 BILLION DOLLARS, on the table and threw heath care, under the table. Bentley was a doctor but he was focused on being the Luv Gov.

Let’s fast forward to 2021. INSANITY is “doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result”. Albert Einstein.

Governor Ivy just married the citizens of Alabama to a “private Partnership” prison for profit plan, to the tune of 3 Billion. What about the Billions lost in the lottery? BILLIONS in dollars and lost opportunity, but we keep doing the same thing, over and over.

Our good Governor Ivy ignored recent studies that indicated a majority of citizens wanted the Medicaid Expansion.

What would be Alabama’s revenue “loss” of Medicaid dollars since 2015? 15 Billion, 20 Billion? How many lives could we have saved? How many hospitals, mostly rural, could have been saved from closing.

If I still have your attention then please read this last link and ask yourself where are all the Christians? You know those conservative Christians?

Alabama's Medicaid program provides medical insurance to groups of low-income people and individuals with disabilities. Medicaid is a nationwide program jointly funded by the federal government and the states. Medicaid eligibility, benefits, and administration are managed by the states within federal guidelines. A program related to Medicaid is the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which covers low-income children above the poverty line and is sometimes operated in conjunction with a state's Medicaid program. Medicaid is a separate program from Medicare, which provides health coverage for the elderly.

The refusal to expand medicaid in Alabama is a classic example why Alabama always finishes last, more often than not. Except of course in football and political corruption where they win a first place.
