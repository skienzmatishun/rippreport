 Tucker Wilsey  Dorsey, like several other politicians, in this county (Haygood, etc) came from Georgia about 13 years ago and took over Catalyst (then it was Stacey) and renamed it ELLIOTT HAYGOOD AND STACEY.   They won the elections to get them in office.  After getting in office they turned it over to Boone.  Since then Catalyst has been the political kingmaker.   
I challenge anyone disbelieving this to look at the campaign finance reports of the politicians running for office.   You will see that a big funder of politicians is Catalyst.
Real Estate companies are also behind Catalyst.   You will see PB (see what PB stands for) is also running Catalyst.   
Real estate developers are running this county right now
