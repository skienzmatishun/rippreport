 Tucker is getting out of the Senate but not politics?  Ignorance on the part of yourself and your church is no excuse.  But, do not worry. We will show you that Tucker Dorsey is not the shining light that you think he is after we show him the door. Maybe that is what your Church should do to you and Dorsey. Loco!  Get with the program. I guess DUI Chris Elliott is such a wonderful person too since he won’t admit even while bible Thumping, that he is a guilty man and should at least publicly apologize and maybe he will be forgiven. God’s children ask for forgiveness. Not mix up the facts and not claim responsibility.  No one does on the Baldwin County Council.  That my friend is going to change with or without catalyst, I meant  (turd dreamers who don’t care about the citizens)!
