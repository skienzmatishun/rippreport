The killing of O.J. French of Bay Minette was over a traffic stop by an office who was fully aware who he was stopping. It was JUSTIFIED by the Baldwin County Major Crimes Unit, who investigates themselves. The Chief of police of Bay Minette, Al Tolbert, is on the major crimes unit and the police officer who killed Mr. French, works for him. Sheriff Mack at the time also was on the Major crimes unit. It is now a federal lawsuit as well as the Johnathan Victor case. Johnathan was killed by a sheriff deputy. He was unarmed and gunned down with an assault rifle, another pending federal lawsuit.

This just two of eight unarmed people killed by police in Baldwin County, and ruled justified by the Major Crimes Division.

Five people were killed when a sheriff deputy chased a car the wrong way down I-10 at over 100 mph, three burned to death. Two other totally innocent motorist’s died in the fiery head on collision. Sheriff Mack was quoted as saying “ that is what happens when you run from the police.”

The most disgusting part of the O.J. French case was when the Mayor of Bay Minette Bob “cover-up” Wills. told a city council crowd that he was friends with the O. J. French’s father and that the family was “OK” with the shooting of their son and the investigation. AN OUTRIGHT LIE. The Mayor needs to loose his position as Mayor, Wake up Bay Minette and Baldwin County.

The Major Crimes Unit is assisted by Baldwin County District Attorney Robert Wilters who uses the “Secret” Grand Jury, to cover the actions of the Major Crimes Unit. He can take a ham sandwich to the Grand Jury and make it a hamburger.

It should be mentioned that Wilters, Mack and former District Attorney David Whetstone colluded with one another to convict an innocent man, Murray Lawrence of murder. He was wrongfully convicted and has been in jail for almost 20 years. Anthony Lowery, the current sheriff, was the lead investigator for the District Attorney at the time and knew of the hidden evidence, the coroner's report.

The county commission is well aware of all these cases and as yet has done nothing about the Major crimes division investigating themselves. Cases like these tarnish the good and ethical reputations police officers and their police departments trying to do the right thing and protect citizens.

A WARNING to the general public------ BEWARE you may be next.
