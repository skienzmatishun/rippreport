The Fairhope Special Election, Oct. 3, was canceled due to a technicality, and a lot of help from people related to Catalyst, Tim Can’t and the good ole boys. The Fairhope City Council Attorney, Marcus McDowell is working overtime to assist the Council, not the Mayor and not the city. Marcus is a direct descendant of the same law firm that has been on the Fairhope payroll for over 20 years. He is a Jack Burrell appointment, backed by the council and approved by Catalyst. The council refused to even consider any other law firm, they knew Marcus would have their back.

The Attorney representing the Probate Judge is David Whetstone and you should see a little conflict of interest if you understand the article below. Whetstone is from the old school and he and Tim Can’t go way back.

Fairhope Times October 3 at 12:36 PM ·

The involvement of former Baldwin District Attorney David Whetstone in calling off the referendum for a city manager scheduled for yesterday is raising eyebrows among long-time city hall watchers and giving rise to various conspiracy theories ... since he was also deeply involved as a private attorney in a similar battle back in 2011 when a city administrator position was being debated. Some now feel it is all a part of a deliberate, organized effort to kill the city manager initiative. When asked for comments, 'Fresh Start' initiative chairman Zunk only replied: "At this point it is out of our hands so we aren't going to worry about it."

The article below is from 2011, by former AL.COM reporter Russ Henderson. thefairhopetimes.blogspot.com

The District Attorney also “assisted” in the decision to delay the election. District Attorney Robert Wilters, a strong supporter of Catalyst, also agreed that the election should be delayed.

They are not called good ole boys for nothing. Catalyst has a strong throat hold on Baldwin County and they want Fairhope back in their pocket.

This is business as usual in Baldwin County. Elected officials ignore any conflicts of interest and to recuse one self from any conflicts of interest is unheard of.

Fairhope has a chance to break the cycle of at large council’s, that are often Catalyst slate candidates, such as the current council.

Please vote Nov. 6th for, a change of government in Fairhope. No Change, means just that NO CHANGE.
