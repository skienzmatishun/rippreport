 Fairhope is fast growing because a bunch of predatory developers  came and molested a small town by buying their political puppets and unleashed a cancerous growth 
This town is not rapidly growing because the developers are adding value to the place, they are merely exploiting the place
That makes THEM the “disgrace.”
Once again, you Catalyst lackie, you just got owned, AGAIN!
Ha!!
