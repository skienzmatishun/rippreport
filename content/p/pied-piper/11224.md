 You guys who think these crooked politicians are good just because they go to church are classic examples of useful idiots.
One of the main points that Catalyst tells its politicians to do is to join a big church and infiltrate it to get voters.
Notice how certain Catalyst politicians are members of the big churches?   
Then they will work their way up in the church and become a deacon, layman, or lead a Bible study class.   Just look around and check out the politicians.   You will see what I mean.
