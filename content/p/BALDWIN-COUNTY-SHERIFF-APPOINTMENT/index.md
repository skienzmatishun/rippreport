Sheriff Hoss Mack has one foot out the door and is hoping to slide his second choice, Anthony Lowery in as his “suggested” replacement. Lowery has professed in the past that he did not want the job. He has to know that a ton of crap out of the Hoss Boss closet, is going to expose some very embarrassing incidents involving BCSO. I do hope Lowery reads all the comments on the Ripp Report. If you think that what we printed is revealing, then please consider all the fill-in-the-blanks comments that we did not print. Names, Dates and evidence that match up to the many many allegations in the comments.


It is not Mack’s decision who becomes the Sheriff. First the Appointment Office for the Governor collects any submitted information supporting or not supportive of Mr. Lowery. Those testimonials will then be studied and reviewed. The appointment director will submit a candidate to replace Sheriff Mack to the Governor, who will make the ultimate decision. You may offer an opinion on who you think should become sheriff other than Lowery.


Most important is that your communication with the Appointment Board is CONFIDENTIAL. Mr. Bass, in person, assured me all correspondence remains in his office and is CONFIDENTIAL. Lawyers, police officers, politicians, victims and citizens are encouraged to weigh in. This is your opportunity for someone to listen about any complaints, previously ignored by the BCSO.


The Ripp Report will encourage families that have lost loved ones at the hands of BCSO to please take this opportunity to tell their story.


Peyton Little-----Ruled by the Baldwin County Sheriff as a suicide. Mr little was a confidential informant for Bay Minette. Shortly after he provided Bay Minette Police with information he was found strangled by a seat belt so tight it had to be cut off him. Ask yourself how could you strangle yourself with a seat belt in a moving car? How could you have no bruises or cuts as the result of being dragged by a car? How could you strangle yourself to death before passing out? BCSO swept this under the rug so fast that they had no answers for the grieving family. Anthony Lowery told the family that “ Peyton wanted to die, so now he is dead.”


Contact the Appointment Board


O.J.French-----Stopped by police in Bay Minette for a simple signal violation. He was shot to death by Bay Minette police and cleared by the Baldwin County Major Crimes Unit. The Bay Minette Police chief was a member of the Major Crimes Unit, which determined the killing was justified. The Bay Minette Mayor’s actions were disrespectful and he offered the family and community no answers and said it was time to “Move On”. The community not only should contact the Appointment Board but unite and remove the Current Mayor in the next election.


The County Commission listened but as usual did nothing:

In memory of O.J. Please attend the check-in and walk in remembrance of Otis French Jr. July 31st

Bay Minette Courthouse.

Robert Yates------An eviction that ended in his death.

>“By this time, defendants were dead-set on killing Yates and at or about 6:30 p.m., the decision was made to breach the Yates residence with all of the SWAT team’s firepower, although the situation was not an exigent one, nor was there an emergency, nor had Yates threatened anyone’s life since firing a warning shot inside his home,” it reads. “Based on bullet holes in Yates’ home and shell casings found outside the residence, SWAT team members shot the home up with their military style weapons without probable cause, as Yates had been silent for several hours. There were more than 114 shells/bullet casings, along with tear gas canisters and concussion grenades left at the scene.”

Johnathan Victor----Unarmed and shot 4 times from 7 yards with a high powered rifle. What started as a single vehicle accident ended in the killing of an innocent man.

The argument was made in a petition for a rehearing filed with the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals on May 7, which asks the three-judge panel to reconsider a decision last month that denied qualified immunity to Baldwin County Sheriff’s Deputy Mark Hunady. This just may be the case that holds BCSO accountable and it may cost Millions.

Five people were killed in a wrong-way BCSO pursuit on I-10 that reached speeds of 110mph. Three people burned to death and the other two died as a result of the accident.


>“Roughly 10 months have passed since father and son Joseph L. Andrews, 81, and Kevin J. Andrews, 54, were killed when the Chevy Malibu driven by Dominic Scotti Garcia Jr., 26, smashed into them while being chased by a Baldwin County Sheriff’s Office (BCSO) deputy against traffic on the interstate. But the sheriff’s office has released almost zero information about the accident since just after it happened.”

 “Naturally, the DA’s office also refused to say anything, so four different families, and the public all continue to sit in limbo while something (possibly?) happens.

It’s hard to read the BCSO’s policy on pursuits and not at least feel a little like this deputy may have broken just about all of the major rules put in place so minor traffic infractions don’t escalate into explosive crashes. “When it becomes apparent that the immediacy of apprehension is outweighed by a clear and unreasonable danger to the deputy and others, the pursuit should be abandoned,” it reads. Driving into oncoming interstate traffic sounds a lot like “clear and unreasonable danger” to me. But I wonder if we’ll ever know whether any of that was even examined, as Mack appears to loathe actually answering to the public. But that’s just kind of the way he does things.”

“Mack was quoted as saying: “That is what happens when you run from the law”

Five human beings are killed and Mack covers the pursuit officer’s ass without any disciplinary action?

ALL four family's should contact the Appointment office.


This is nine people that lost their lives that we know of.


How about the wrongful convictions:

Sheriff Mack, Prosecutor David Whetstone, and Judge Robert Wilters withheld exculpatory evidence from the defense and sent an innocent man to jail for 20 years. Anthony Lowery was an investigator in the case and had knowledge of the available evidence. All four remained silent and most enjoyed promotions on the back of an innocent man.

The Ripp Report has done its part. See the letter to the Appointment office below:
