Fairhope City Council has been pedaling backwards their whole term. They now have a chance to pedal forward, putting Fairhope on the map, when it comes to the city supporting education.

{{< socialpreview url="https://rippreport.com/p/pedaling-backwards/" >}}

Alabama’s Equity Funding formula is not equitable, when it comes to Baldwin County. A Fairhope solution, discussed for years has been a 3 mill property tax in a designated school district. The Fairhope Education Advisory Committee \[FEAC\], after consideration of the 2015 Akribos Group Academic Audit and reviewing the needs of all 5 schools in Fairhope have suggested to the City Council a 3 mill property tax. This district,6, would be inside the boundaries of the Fairhope schools feeder pattern. The estimated income from the 3 mills is 1.88 million.

{{< socialpreview url="https://thefairhopetimes.blogspot.com/2019/02/special-school-tax-will-need-councils.html" >}}

In order to have a referendum on the issue the Council has to jump through several hoops even to make certain deadlines. It is a good suggestion, however, Baldwin County voters are not inclined to tax themselves. What is going to stop the County from raiding the fund. That is what they did with the penny tax, then County Commissioner Chris Elliott and School Superintendent Eddie Tyler skimmed off 200,000 dollars a year from the school tax for County infrastructure. Why would we not expect that to happen down the road with the 3 mills!

The Fairhope City Council can begin pedaling forward by considering the Mayor’s suggestions to reach the same goal. The Council would be able to approve over 70% of the 1.88 million goal, by Council action, passing a Permanent Ordinance. NOW The Council, FEAC and the Mayor are on the same page, as far as the ultimate goal of 1.88 million. The Mayor is committed to schools and has presented proposals that need careful consideration before committing to a referendum which has little chance of passing. Council President Jack Burrell”s comment “ I want out of the school business”, was a sad commentary to the overall conversation. Mr Burell is more interested in the Airport and 2020 elections than Schools. He would rather kick the can down the road to a tax referendum, that he feels will fail. School Principals and teachers should weigh in on the options, take a chance on the referendum or go with a Permanent Council Ordinance. It should be noted the Mayor is on board for the 3 mill tax, she just feels it is more prudent to use the Fairhope Equitable School Plan first as a stepping stone to the 3 mill tax.

Let’s hope the council does not allow Catalyst or their ego’s to get in the way of what could be the vehicle that spares our teachers from being fundraisers and allows them to teach. Fairhope will be debt free in 2019. The Mayor’s proposal is to use 10% of the income from sales tax, estimated at 800,000 to a million a year, for the bulk of the 1.88 million dollar goal. The Council can do that NOW. If the Council goes ahead with the referendum and it fails then they get another F.
