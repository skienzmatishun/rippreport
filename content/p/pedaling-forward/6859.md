 People please wake up and see what is happening. Baldwin County is the fastest-growing county in the Southeastern U.S.

And it has no planning apparatus. No zoned growth plan with diversified areas. No impact fees. No new infrastructure. 

It is the wild west of real estate!!! Every hot blonde and brunette with a good pair is moving here to help exploit the trend. B.C. is doomed I tell ya!

Doomed. Catalyst has already defeated you Rippster.
