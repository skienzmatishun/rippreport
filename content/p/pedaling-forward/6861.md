 It would be absolutely stupid to put in a mountain bike trail. That should have never even been considered. It will be detrimental to our conservation efforts and as soon as someone gets hurt and they will. They “WILL” sue the city and win. There you go!  Just saved y’all $10,000! Plus having  additional lawsuits filed against Fairhope that we the taxpayers are responsible for. Every nut in this town forgets there are consequences for the terrible actions of this Council. This Fairhope Council really SUX!  Let them start paying for these scams out of their own pockets and see how quick these dumbasses stop coming up with stupid ideas!  Mountain Bike Trail!  LOL LOL LOL LOL
