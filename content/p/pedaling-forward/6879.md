 She has been amazing.....even at her worst, she has always been better for Fairhope than our previous Mayors.   I don't know her personally but am happy that she has done such great things for out City; she has proven to everyone that we desperately needed a new leader.   Because we are so over-lapped with the county and various school districts, she needs our support to continue doing the best for Fairhope.  I have not heard much from the coin-operated Council denouncing her lately, evidence that they can no longer find support for their negative propaganda.   I am 100% behind her;  can't wait to rid the City of Jack Burrell as Council President ( he is probably a great member of the CC because of his institutional knowledge but needs to step aside b/c of conflicts and bad judgment and the airport issues and his unwillingness to follow the CC rules).   Regardless of the CC, Karin has my vote and full support in 2020!
