 Things are going pretty good in fairhope lately. I think the development problem is overblown. All big cities have traffic. It's the price we must pay for progress. We aren't a small town anymore. Soon we will be a city and we should annex the outlying areas and get that tax money. I would like to see more mixed use developments in fairhope with residential and commercial mixed. If the election were held tomorrow I would vote for only one of the councilmen and from what I hear he isn't running. It will be interesting to see who steps up and grabs the torch. If Burrell runs I think he will have a hard time but will get the hard core old fairhope vote. I'm wondering if that's enough anymore though because there are a lot more new voters in the city limit. The Triangle should be mixed use development high end restaurants shops and condos. It would be so nice. The kids are crammed in the schools. We need to build more real buildings. This requires work with the county and city and school board to find funding due to growth. These problems can be solved if we work with the other governments. I just think this council is kind of a lame duck after this past year's setbacks. I have to agree they have not done much.
