 First of all, there is no such thing as an "Arbortorium",as depicted on the Kant era map of the Triangle. Perhaps well-intentioned, the bike trail would be a nightmare on the quite sandy and erodible soils of the Triangle.However, like most feasibility studies, none are designed to disappoint the political proponents who proposed them, so I assume they will be built with money we do not have.
