 This council is crooked.   They literally spot zoned a piece of property by the north east corner of Morphy and 98.
The property was bought for a restaurant to be built but the property was zoned for light industrial.   So the council changed the rules so that restaurants are industrial 
If I lived in that neighborhood I would sue 
But since the people are sheep and do not stand up for their rights, they get run over
