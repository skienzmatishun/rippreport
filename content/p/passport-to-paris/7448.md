 I wish that the Paris Air Show was the worst thing we have to worry about!?  There has been nothing done to create a better environment (of any subject) or to try and tackle the increase in traffic for the past 10 years. Lots of men in Faihope treat women like they are dogs. That’s not the way most of us were brought up. So many cowards!  It’s shown on a daily basis and especially during the council meeting.  The whole world is laughing at us. These people who have to tell you that they are Christians?  Never met a Christian that went out of their way to tell me that they were, without them showing a whole lot of disappointment within about 5 minutes. You real Christians know exactly what I’m talking about. Happy 4th. Lot of bull crap being shoveled around Faihope.
