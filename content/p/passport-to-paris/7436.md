 Ha ha!!!!!  The joke is on the folks of Baldwin County.  Baldwin County has all these people making all this money.  So many people here just waiting to be taxed and governed - by "Conservative Christians" of course.....
Now if you live in the poorer counties around the state you will be subsidized by the fine Christian folks of Shelby, Baldwin, and Madison Counties.  A'int life grand?
