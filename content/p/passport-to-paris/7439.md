 There are two main reasons that these politicians go to the Paris Air Show:
1. Because it is in Paris and they are taking a vacation on our dime.
2. So that they can make political connections that will further enrich them.  Shucks, the County Commission and the mayor of Daphne went to the Paris Air Show.  Do you REALLY thinks they all went just to bring work to Alabama?  Heck, Airbus was already in Mobile.  If they really wanted to bring jobs to their area (ha ha) all they would have had to do was run over to Mobile.  But no, it wasn't Paris. 
What a joke.  The bigger joke is that we taxpayers put up with this.  IT IS OUR FAULT THAT WE TOLERATE THIS AND KEEP VOTING THESE LEECHES (uh, I mean Christian Conservatives) BACK INTO OFFICE.
