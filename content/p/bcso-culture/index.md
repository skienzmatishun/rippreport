Antony Lowery, Baldwin County’s “appointed” sheriff has been bragging that the sheriff department has developed, and adopted a culture within the department that has taken years to develop.

A culture of lies, wrongful incarceration, deadly shootings, investigating themselves and finding themselves innocent 100 percent of the time. A culture that involves blanket immunity, no transparency and absolutely no accountability.

1. It is legal for the sheriff to lie, however a citizen could be arrested for lying to the sheriff.
2. Let that sink in, then consider the fact that in the upcoming sheriff election that the sheriff is the custodian of the ballot boxes, of the same election where he is a candidate. Now go back and read number one.
3. Baldwin County citizens do not trust the Baldwin County Sheriff Department. Many deputies want change and are ashamed of the “Culture” within the department, those are facts!

The most recent lie that Lowery is spinning involves the execution of Johnathan Victor. His proclamation that Mr. Victor was an example of suicide by cop is categorically false. Lowery never demonstrates any compassion for the many victims, or their family’s, that have been harmed, killed or wrongfully incarcerated.

{{< socialpreview url="https://www.lagniappemobile.com/news/baldwin_county/sheriff-lowery-praises-defense-verdict/article_9d467150-3eb5-4772-a319-a66e9632bbbf.html" >}}

Baldwin County Sheriff Anthony Lowery on Friday lauded a federal jury’s decision clearing Deputy Lt. Matthew Hunady of wrongdoing in the 2017 fatal shooting of Jonathan Victor.

Defense attorneys described the case as a clear example of suicide-by-cop.

“Victor was shot 4 times by an assault rifle from 7 yards, He was unarmed and confused. Instead of assisting him the sheriff department killed him.”

Plaintiffs argued Victor was suffering a mental health crisis and was considered a barricaded subject. They claimed Hunady arrived on the scene where Victor was involved in a single-vehicle wreck on the interstate’s median and “rushed to judgment,” hurrying Victor out of his vehicle and helping to create the situation where he believed he was forced to shoot.

Let’s add a little insult to injury and charge the victim’s family for trying to seek justice.

During trial, Chisesi’s lawyers argued Hunady took unreasonable steps in a “rush to judgement” at the scene and escalated the incident. They argued Hunady was the first to claim Victor could have a gun, and his actions leading up to Victor’s defiant advance violated police standards. This included allegedly rushing Victor out of the car instead of waiting and requesting help from crisis negotiators, creating hostility by putting someone suffering a mental health crisis at gunpoint and not using his stun gun.

> I am a deputy within the BCSO. For reasons of obvious nature, I will not leave my name. I love my job, but as like other people I need my paycheck. Sheriff Lowrey is NOT the person most of my colleagues want leading this department. He has never been for all of us, only a select few. He is only wanting the power of the position and not to help us and the citizens. He is horrible to work with and has never had to deal with a drugged up agitator at night by himself. He is hiding and covering up issues within our office, to the point that people are leaving and the retired deputies are hoping he doesn’t win the election. Please vote for someone other than him to lead us.

Lying and conspiring. Want a perfect example than it is the wrongful conviction of Murray Lawrence Jr. Lowery was the lead investigator and he never ever produced one shred of evidence against Lawrence. In fact he Hoss Mack, Judge, at the time, Robert Wilters and David Whetstone hid exculpatory evidence from the defense. This is the CULTURE Mack and Lowery have adopted.

CULTURE?

Is this another example of the CULTURE? Read the article very carefully.

{{< socialpreview url="https://www.lagniappemobile.com/news/lawsuit-filed-against-baldwin-county-deputies-over-deadly-2018-eviction/article_0e3724fe-d77d-5fd3-a6dc-9c5c6ada206b.html" >}}

Allegedly, one of the SWAT team members was deputy Justin Correa, the son of Robert Correa. Suggesting the plaintiff has seen some evidence subsequently provided by investigators, the complaint claims Robert Correa warned his son about getting involved due to a potential conflict of interest, but the younger deputy said he was “gonna go in and kill this f\*cker if I have to.”

Mack and Lowery hand in hand exacting their CULTURE on Steve Nodine.

> Nodine prosecution was a political hit piece against him because Mack, Lowery, and Newcomb wanted it to be a guilty verdict to shore up their existence for the DA’s Office and the Sheriff’s Office. Lowery thought it was a big deal and wanted to try to get him to confess in the interview, but Nodine never wavered. So they took it to a grand jury instead. Lowery has got to go. No more

Mr French got stoped for a broken taillight and ended up being shot to death. The Baldwin County Major Crimes Unit with the assistance of then Mayor Wills simply ruled the death as a “justified shooting”. A great example of the CULTURE Lowery has employed within the Sheriff department. By the way Mayor Wills is no longer Mayor.

## OJ French killed in Bay Minette

Another suicide? Tell me how a confidential informant for the Sheriff department and the police department of Bay Minette strangles himself with a seat belt sitting in the front seat of a moving car? Oh Yea the seat belt was so tight they had to cut it free.. more of that CULTURE.

## PEYTON LITTLE

That person was able to cut the belt away from Little's neck and the teen was taken to North Baldwin Infirmary where he was pronounced dead.

DEADLY INTERSTATE CRASH The wrong way chase down I-10 eventually claimed five lives with sheriff Hoss Mack quoted as saying “that’s what happens when you run from the law.” CULTURE.

I could go on but I am going to save a hell of a lot more for later.

For the sake of Baldwin County let’s change the culture.

Vote for Matt Mckenzie
