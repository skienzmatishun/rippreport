 But Ripp, you have that Baldwin Economic Development Alliance or whatever they call those retired "Executives" who are trying to sell the site.  Like I said earlier, I will either take up golf or get a hobby if I make it to retirement and promise I will NOT join a "Development Council" where retired guys bug the crap out of those still working on how to do their jobs.  Are you listening South Alabama Workforce Development Council?  I remember these guys bugged the crap out of the school board until they were asked how they were going to come up with the money.  You could hear crickets.  They never bugged us again.
Just send me off to the Paris Airshow, or Anaheim, or other exotic locales where I can be put up in a five star hotel and I will try to remember the Megasite.
