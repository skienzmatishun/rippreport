There are two types of salesman. The ones that put a sign up and wait for the phone to ring, they usually have the most bravado and produce the least. Then you have the ones that knock on doors, they are used to being turned down however they keep knocking on those doors and are the successful ones.

Baldwin County is experiencing an explosion of growth especially the middle and coastal part of the county. All that growth can be misleading, what may appear to be a booming economy has a dark side as well. Is Baldwin County going to depend on housing as a major industry? Is Baldwin County going to become a job market primarily for the service industry? What jobs are going to be available for the next generation?

While there were no mega deals developed for Baldwin County in 2018, the county did enjoy another stellar year of growth in manufacturing and retail as the county’s economy continued to boom. Baldwin County was number one in the state in incoming business, workforce talent attraction and job growth for the year. “By all economic …

Booming Baldwin has a gain of 200 jobs. Think about that, 200 jobs, four new or relocated companies, have made Baldwin County home. We certainly welcome them and wish them success in their business. 200 jobs in Baldwin County does not sound like a “Booming” economy. Where are the manufacturing jobs, car plants or support manufacturing for the airplane industry?

North Baldwin still has the, onion, mega site. Who is knocking on doors, FULL TIME, trying to sell the mega site? NOBODY they are waiting on the phone to ring.

The 200 job gain has now been offset by a 200 job loss. No gain in a booming economy! Something is wrong! A lack of manufacturing. Let’s hope that when the mega site sells that the county does not pay someone to buy it by offering ridiculous incentives.

North Baldwin is an excellent location for large scale manufacturing but if you are waiting for that phone to ring, you may have a long wait.

The Baldwin County Commission, State Senator and Representatives and Mayors should look for some sales people who knock on doors. There should be a specific marketing approach that would target large and small scale manufacturing in North Baldwin. This could include some sort of incentive to independent sales people that normally would not operate in that market. The more people knocking on doors the better.

Stop waiting for the phone to ring, KNOCK ON DOORS
