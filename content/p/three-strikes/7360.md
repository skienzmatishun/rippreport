 The possibility of Jack Burrell having an engineering Licence is about as much as Obama having been a good president. Zero chance. When or if he runs again he will be vetted on any kind of license that he may have told us for years as well as the Fairhope police report, you will see other city’s police records as well. There is one person that has stepped us with a $10,000 to have Jack Burrell correctly vetted. This will be great as well as entertaining I’m sure. Looking forward to more lies from Jack Burrell. Whether you are a Jackass fan or not. Next time you see Burrell, ask him to provide proof of having a Engineering Licence. He works for all of us so their should not be a problem with him providing it. It’s just that simple.
