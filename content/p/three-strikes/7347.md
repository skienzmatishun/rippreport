 You nailed it, Chess Player.  From up here in Spanish Fort, I see a free-for-all with the out of control growth.  What is more, notice how the developers (aka robbers) are the same folks that give money to these same public "servants."
Do NOT bother asking how these "servants" sleep at night because the question mistakenly assumes they would need to have a conscience in the first place to even keep them up at night.
These "servants" sleep well - very well.
It is amazing what one can due once one jettisons their conscious and any trace of morality.
