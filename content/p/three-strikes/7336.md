 So everyone is cool with Burrell and Company giving away a $20 million asset like the Triangle to their friends under the guise of a "conservation easement"? Why is everyone afraid to call these guys on the city council what they are--crooks! They are doing the work of people who line their pockets and provide their marching orders. Let me tell you boys and girls something:
If you don't replace this council Fairhope is doomed.
Doomed I tell you.
