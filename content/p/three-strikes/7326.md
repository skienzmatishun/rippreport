 Some people have been questioning whether Jack Burrell is lying about being a licensed engineer.  I did a little bit of research.  His website for the last election says he works for Integrated Innovations as does his LinkedIn profile which lists him as the Principal Structural Engineer.  Both sites say he continues to hold the position.  It's possible he hasn't updated these pages, but according to the license record search, he is not currently licensed in Alabama.  The only site that lists him under that position is ZoomInfo.  ZoomInfo says they get their information from personal profile updates and credible web sources.  I'm guessing their source is LinkedIn.  So it doesn't say much.  There's no mention of him on the company website when searched through Google.  So, nothing definitive.  There is an email button on the ZoomInfo page but you have to pay to see it.
