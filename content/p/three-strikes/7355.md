 Let me tell you about LinkedIn - you personally can put WHATEVER you want To on it.  I am a professional &amp; have had several employees that have left &amp; I have looked at their LinkedIn &amp; they have LIED about what they did &amp; their position.  Totally LIED  they put they were some supervisor on it etc. -  TOTALLY LIED - I would NOT trust anything that is on LInkedin at all. totally false info that  people are putting anything they want to to make themselves look better.  I Totally HATE social media - most is totally false info.  When are we going to wake up???
