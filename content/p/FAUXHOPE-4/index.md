Want to know why so many people refer to Fairhope as Fauxhope? Consider this:

Fauxhope is a tree city. What a joke Fauxhope is more responsible for tree REMOVAL than anyone.

The caption is a live oak that HAD a 6 foot 2 inch diameter. It stood proud for decades, if not a century. The tree was on a knoll making it the tallest tree in the area. I was told by city officials that they had no knowledge of its removal. I don’t doubt that. Every vehicle entering and exiting Publix or the neighborhood had the pleasure of seeing the tree while traveling down Parker Road.

The subdivision behind the tree and across from Publix eliminated over 90 per cent of those trees.

{{< socialpreview url="https://rippreport.com/p/liar-liar-pants-on-fire-2/" >}}

When they built the Publix on Parker road they clear cut every living thing on the property, bulldozed the city and county right of way, and basically did whatever the hell they wanted. Then came the apartments which were fiercely opposed due to its close proximity to fly creek. The “signature” apartments suffered two minor floods and were sold off in three years. So much for a “signature” apartment complex. The promise of a boulevard on Parker road was as false as any of the developers' promises.

Now go up Parker Road past the Publix entrance and past the fire station and look at the third project by the developer that has stripped acres of trees. They cleared that property by knocking the trees down and hauling off tons of wood and hauling in red dirt to prepare the site for construction. Just like Publix and the apartments, the developer, a major contributor to the City Council and Mayor, has a green light to do whatever the hell he pleases without any oversight.

No other developers would have the blessing of the Council or Mayor

FAUXHOPE

What a joke this is a fairy tale, spun by cheap ass developers. Read the article carefully they needed $369.000 to fund the project. Single tax donated $184.500 and two anonymous donors have given $50.000 and $100.000 for a total of $334.500. So that would leave $34,000 donated by people not knowing this is a real estate deal. Two people anonymously gave 150.000 in order to push the project forward. How much do you want to bet that the donations came from developers? This is not about history, this is a real estate deal by developers that need the hut moved so they can claim the corner of Parker and 98 for development. Just stay tuned! As soon as the hut is gone you will see development of the site begin. The City Council, major sponsors and the Mayor know the truth. This is FAUXHOPE.

FAUXHOPE

How about that waterfront project that Ballooned from 6.2 Million to 10 million. The project is five and a half years late and another batch of trees gone. 10 MILLION Dollars and very little cosmetic changes. The council said the extra, approximately 4 million, was due to an increase in materials. It was all grant money so who cares? Just another developer deal, it is the way the good ole boy developer friendly Council and Mayor handle business. Someone should forensically audit the project.

FAUXHOPE

How about the Jack Burrell Airport. Have you noticed how it has grown? The development of the airport is in the hands of developers. Only 1 percent of the Fauxhope population uses the airport. That is about the same percentage of people who know what is going on and what future plans are.

FAUXHOPE

{{< socialpreview url="https://rippreport.com/p/catalyst-the-three-bs-and-chuckee-cheeze/" >}}

What about the recreation land purchased by the Airport? That slick deal was made by Councilman Boone Brown and Burrell. This little side deal will go down as corrupt as it gets. Someone or maybe three people made a bank on this under the table purchase. It was made in a hurry, purchased, and then abandoned and leased back to farmers for $9000 a year. Now the council is hiring a consultant to try and determine the best use of the land. Let’s see what BS they come up with.

FAUXHOPE

Where only 12 percent of the voters participated in the last election. The developer sponsored at large council and double dipping Mayor were re-elected. So expect no change, no transparency, absolutely no accountability and a continuation of doing business their way, at your expense. There is no need to go to a city council meeting because you are not part of the plan.

Welcome to FAUXHOPE smell the flowers.
