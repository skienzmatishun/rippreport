 Mr. Ripp's comment that "this agenda is not what we voted for" is incorrect. Mayor Wilson received 3522 votes. Jack Burrell received 5087 votes -- that is 1,565 more votes than Wilson received, and since he was an incumbent, we have to assume that this was based on his performance during his first 4 year term as President of the Board. Jay Robinson received 765 more votes than Wilson did, and Robert Brown received 760 more votes than she did. Kevin Boone received only 18 fewer votes than Mayor Wilson did. 
Based upon votes as a measurement of the will of the people, don't we have to assume that the citizens want the Council to be a large part of the decision -making process?
I also question all of the references to the Mayor as the Councilmen'S "boss." It is my understanding that, based upon State law and our population, we now have a "weak Mayor-strong Council" structure, with a division of responsibilities. The Mayor has the right to hire and fire employees, but the Council has the power over appropriations.
The balance of power between branches of government is part of the genius of our Constitution. No one person or entity has all the right answers.
This is not supposed to be a war. It is a negotiation between what we must begin by assuming are people with differing opinions but the same goal: what is best for Fairhope.
