 It's his privilege to serve us! 
Tim Kant posted on Facebook. His statements don't match his actions. He said he hoped for a smooth transition. He did NOTHING to make it smooth and he along with Jack continue to bad mouth the new mayor. Burrell is not good for the morale of the city. He is no LEADER!!
Just like in any job... If you bad mouth your boss, gossip, or make things difficult for your boss.to do their job.. You get fired!! 
It's going to be a long 4 years if the employees and council do not get on board with the mayor.
Be a SOLUTION &amp; not a PROBLEM
