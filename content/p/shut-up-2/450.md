 Wondering why Tim Kant spoke up regarding the two fired city employees. if he was having meetings at his house then were these two employees attending the meetings along with others.   Was he feeling guilty that he may have helped bring this situation to a head.   Some people just refuse to accept change.  Tim Kant you did NOT get elected again, so butt out!!
