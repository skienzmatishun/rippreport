 They aren't!  Seriously, with the problems in the world/county/state, why do you believe that anyone cares about the drama in Fairhope?  We have fair and free elections; our voters are primarily old people who are easily swayed by Burrell and Co......this is a running joke (probably created by Burrell) that the FBI cares. If the taxpayers of Fairhope don't care, it is a MESSAGE FROM GOD that the FBI doesn't care......&gt;&gt;LOL!!!
