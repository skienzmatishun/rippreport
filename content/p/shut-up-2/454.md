 I agree with Mayor Wilson and her reasoning to want the Airport land back in the city's ownership! I also believe the Mayor has the right to hire and fire whomever she sees fit, as long as she is following the law. The city council has NO BUSINESS TELLING HER SHE CANNOT HIRE FOR 60 Days!!! They also have NO RIGHT TO KICK HER OUT OF MEETINGS!!! STOP BEHAVING LIKE CHILDREN! UNLESS YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO HIDE???? Got caught with your HAND IN THE WRONG BANK???  SHAME ON YOU!
