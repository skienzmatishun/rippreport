 People will not vote for these fools again except Conyers. People are waking up to the corruption and unethical behavior of Burrell &amp; Boone!!  Brown is Burrell's whipping boy! It's obvious the nudges he gives brown during city council meetings. Just go back and watch some of the work sessions.  Wake up Fairhope! Time to put people on city council with no business interests!!!
