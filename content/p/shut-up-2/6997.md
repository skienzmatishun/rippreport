 Scared for Fairhope and Baldwin. I don't know if we can survive the developers. There is no planning in place for the county. It's a free for all and a recipe for disaster on an epic
scale. Stupid is as it does. Nobody is planning anything road wise except the three new bridges across the intracoastal to canal road so they can build new neighborhoods for the landowners on the other side. 59 will soon be a vertical parking lot. The three new bridges put thousands more cars on the key. There's only one road. Who's running this show? The developers and the politicians who are financed by them. Ripp is on to them. Is anyone listening to what he's saying?
