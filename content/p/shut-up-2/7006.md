 Fair elections? The only fair election was the 2016 municipal election when the Secretary of State oversaw it due to Kant's father-in-law managing ballots for the 3 elections BEFORE 2016.  

Trust me, the FBI is has been investigating the corruption that happened before this administration.
Burrell, Boone and Kant should be concerned!
