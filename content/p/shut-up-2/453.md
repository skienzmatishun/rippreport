 These firings do NOT need to be blamed on Mayor Wilson,  the blame is on Tim Kant &amp; Sherry &amp; Jennifer for being so naive as to continue to side with Tim Kant.  Tim Kant is to blame - he needs to LET IT GO - HE LOST!!!  If they were near retirement &amp; let go - Why were they so stupid to go to Tim Kant's house to these "Secret" Meetings - it is only THEIR fault &amp; THEIR fault only - they need to go to TIM KANT as to why they lost their jobs!!!   It is called  INSUBORDINATION - this is a NO BRAINER - Sherry &amp; Jennifer know exactly WHY they lost their jobs.  Do not let them give anyone a pity party!
