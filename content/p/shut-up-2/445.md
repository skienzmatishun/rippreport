 It's disappointing that the polarization of our opinions on how our local government are to run have become so toxic.  For the most part, when a new mayor, governor, president are elected - it is customary &amp; expected that they will hire and appoint new people in positions that will support their position...I.e. Clean House!  That is precisely what is going on in Fairhope. Everyone newly elected whether the mayor or counsel is trying to fulfill the pledges they made while running for office &amp; it's a smoother path if you have support. 

So could we please have more respect for each other &amp; our differences. 
Stop the attacking from all sides and move forward positively knowing that we will not agree
We need TERM LIMITS so this web doesn't repeat itself &amp; DISTRICTS so our community is uniquely represented

Let's love Fairhope together because what we really have here are very "1st World problems"!!!!!
