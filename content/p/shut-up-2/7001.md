 Builder, with 50,000 we will have more crime, more taxes, and a lower quality of life just so you can “roll.”   Actually you will be rolling in money you made as you cashed in on stealing our quality of life.
If 50,000 is so great then why are people fleeing big cities?  We know your type will leave after yiu have finished trashing this place.  We just wish you would leave now.   
The only bright spot here is when you overbuild and saturate the home market, new home sales will collapse and you will go broke
