 I completely agree with you. I can't believe we elected a nut.  Wilson is way over her head and, sadly, taking bad advice from a very select few. Anyone who feels like they need to send out a dissertation on every little conversation and decision she's had since November having to do with the Airport Authority isn't showing transparency. She's just scared of getting blamed for something.  So sorry she got elected. Bet she is too!
