 I am fixing to blow a gasket with all this mess being stirred up in Fairhope - Tim Kant is behind it all - he still wants control &amp; will do whatever it takes to undermine the current Mayor who the CITIZENS of Fairhope elected.  The Citizens were tired of the corruption &amp; fraud that has been in Fairhope for YEARS!!  If you have lived in Fairhope for less than 50 years you have no idea what all has gone on for years.  What the current Mayor is trying to do is clean this mess up - and those that are continuing to side with Kant &amp; his chosen will suffer the consequences &amp; that is what is happening.  Sherry Sullivan did a GREAT job - she must had been one of Kants chosen ones to continue to create havoc.  All the citizens that have a blind eye to all the corruption will be woken up soon - I hope the doors are fixing to be blown wide open with ALL the fraud that had been going on.  YES,  there is much more so you ought to watch who you are siding with.  You will be embarrassed when it ALL DOES come out!
