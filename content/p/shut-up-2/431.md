 Thank you Mr. Ripp, Mr. Mosher and Mayor Wilson along with everyone else who has played a part in exposing the ugliness eating away at our fair city for so long.

Even if there WERE reasonable answers to all of these questions, our representatives should be above reproach in all dealings on our behalf. It is sickening to me to see the rot that has infected the rest of this country with greed, self serving back room deals and a blanket of lies so thick an entire populace is spinning out of control has been lurking in our literal back yard.

Root it out. Bring on the light. We, the people of Fairhope, are a haven in the darkness, not a willing participant in its spread.

Well done. All of you. Keep it up. See you at the meetings!
