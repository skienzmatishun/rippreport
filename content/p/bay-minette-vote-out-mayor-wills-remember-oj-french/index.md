Of all the Mayors in Baldwin County. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=mayor+wills&as_sitesearch=rippreport.com">Mayor Bob Wills</a> is the most disgusting. Every voter in Bay Minette should remember <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=oj+french&as_sitesearch=rippreport.com">O. J. French </a>, every voter white, black or brown. Mayor Wills lied to the family and to the community. He said the family was OK with the circumstances surrounding the death of their son. Think about that! An outright lie that Wills later doubled down on. Wills supported the kangaroo court of the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=bcso&as_sitesearch=rippreport.com">Sheriff Department</a>. The <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=BCMCU&as_sitesearch=rippreport.com">Baldwin County Major Crimes Unit</a> who investigates themselves.

{{< socialpreview url="https://rippreport.com/p/federal-civil-rights-lawsuit-involves-bcso-and-major-crimes-unit/" >}}

BCMCU has no credibility. They are investigating themselves and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Tolbert&as_sitesearch=rippreport.com">Chief Tolbert</a> of Bay Minette is the Chairman? It is prosperous to believe BCMCU could conduct an unbiased investigation of their own members.

<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/otis-french-sr-vs.-city-of-bay-minette-alabama-complaint.pdf">A federal lawsuit has been filed on behalf of O. J. French and his family</a>. In Alabama especially Baldwin County there is no justice in the court system, you have to go to federal court.

Mayor Wills is the epitome of the good ole boys in Baldwin County, he is a senior member. Wills has used his position to further his ambitions and bank account.

{{< socialpreview url="https://rippreport.com/p/cover-up/" >}}

Mayor Wills is more interested in his golf game, and his checkbook, than consoling the citizens of Bay Minette. He has done everything that would make you suspicious of a ‚Äúcover up‚Äù. Mayor Wills reputation of questionable self serving deals that he has been involved in, have resulted in ethics complaints and Alabama Bar complaints. Those complaints fell on deaf ears but we all know the primary duty of the Alabama Bar and the Ethics Commission is to ‚Äúcover up‚Äù for corrupt politicians.

Bay Minette deserves better and a change in Mayor is the only way it will come about. Mayor Wills does not want to debate or answer any hard questions. He is hiding at the golf course or in the safety of Tolbert‚Äôs office, who also should be given his walking papers.

Bay Minette is your community not Bob Wills or Al Tolbert. It's YOURS.

You have a choice. stay with Wills and suffer the consequences of the good ole boys or elect a new Mayor for the betterment of the entire community.

ELECT JOSHUA BROWN
