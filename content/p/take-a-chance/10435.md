 Trump lost the election, not because of Biden, but because they voted against Trump. That's why they didn't get the senate or much of a gain in the house. A lot of people in this country do not agree with how he ran the country. The problem is the lack of choice in our system. Why should I be expected to vote for someone because they say they are a republican? Sometimes the quiet majority favors voting the obnoxious loud minority out.  The results show that the majority of voters do not buy that there is a threat of antifa. It shows that the majority of voters are not looking at BLM in a co-intel protocol kind of way. Read the co-intel protocol documents leaked decades ago. It's a known tactic to focus on the minority of bad actors and minimize the majority of peaceful protesters.

They are "fighting the fraud" by taking it to court and denying that the suit is for anything everyone is screaming about.  They are "fighting the fraud" by attempting to interfere by loopholes in Michigan. They get out of court, and start claiming things they never bring up in court.

Pelosi, etc. are not great, but don't be blind to what your side is doing.
