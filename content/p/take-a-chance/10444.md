 If Alabama is 49 out of 50 then why do Yankees flock to Alabama?    Why don’t they stay in their northern paradise?
Also I notice how Yankee liberal boomers never answer for their treason in the 1960’s.  Well maybe Jane Fonda did but the rest really did not own up to their antics.   This is because their sense of entitlement tells them they don’t have to.
