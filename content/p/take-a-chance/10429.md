 Just because someone is a "senior" does not mean they deserve automatic respect.
Many of today's seniors were hippies back in the 1960's.  They were spoiled brats that demonstrated the war, did dope, followed Timothy O'Leary, disrespected their elders, and almost ruined this country.
Now that they are old, their chickens have come home to roost.
Yes, I also know that not all baby boomers were like this.  Some actually fought in the war and served the country like Ripp.  I may not agree with his politics but I do respect him for his service and his sincerity.
