 Oh Ripp,
First the vaccine will be out
Second, the death rate of COVID has been overstated.  If a person died in a car wreck and it was found he had COVID when he was killed then COVID was the listed cause of his death because the hospitals make more money
Third, people who actually die of COVID have so-morbidities which even the flus would have killed them
Fourth, this COVID crap is getting old - real old.  Let those with the co-morbidities hide in their homes.  The rest of us need to work
Fifth, I donot think the whole country should shut down just for one half of a percent
Sixth, if you think Americans will do another lockdown then there will be pushback
Seventh, why is it that the blue states want to do lock downs while their politicians go to Hawaii and throw dinner parties in Napa?
Eighth, how is Florida doing without the COVID restrictions?  any worse than a blue state?
Ninth, we have been wearing masks since April - how has that helped?
Tenth, it is OK for the rioters to not wear masks.  Refer back to item number six
In summary, the COVID political football has now turned into hypocrisy
