 Give me one affidavit that isn't bullshit.  For example, one affidavit gives the voter totals of Minnesota for Michigan's numbers. Show me the evidence of Dominion software doing that.  Why have they not brought it up in court?  Why do they, in court, where there are consequences to lying, claim no widespread fraud. They only claim it in press conferences.  Why is that?
