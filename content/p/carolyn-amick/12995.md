 Paul-
You know Iâ€™m so very sorry for your loss. I always loved listening to all your adventures with Carolyn. She was a beautiful woman, a wonderful host and the most amazing painter and sculptor. Im so fortunate that Carolyn took the time to show My son Joe all her fantastic art pieces.
 See you soon friend.
