The only way to effectively dismantle the good ole boy system is vote them out. Years ago a gentleman by the name of Lynn Stacy was the go to guy to get elected, to anything in Baldwin County. Stacy then added two cohorts and formed Stacy, Elliot and Haygood.

<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=chris+elliott&as_sitesearch=rippreport.com">Chris Elliott</a> became a county commissioner and Haygood became Mayor of Daphne. Once they were elected the name changed to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=catalyst&as_sitesearch=rippreport.com">Catalyst</a>. and for years operated under that name. The general public started to catch on to the dirty politics that Catalyst represented, so the name changed again. Today Scott Boone consulting represents the cabal of good ole boys of Baldwin County. They do not operate in the public’s eyes and prefer to stay in the shadows. IF it is a Scott Boone candidate then they are confirmed CATALYST.

Baldwin County former <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=hoss+mack&as_sitesearch=rippreport.com">Sheriff Hoss Mack</a> was the driving force of all the named groups. Hoss put many Judges and Mayors in office. Hoss retired and left the sheriff reins to Anthony Lowery as well as the responsibility to keep those good ole boy connections warm and fuzzy. However Hoss’s absence and public sentiment has fractured their cabal and many Mayors, council members, Judges and alike are facing stiff competition from candidates that are fed up with the corruption.

When you have Mayors and Judges in office for 15, 20 or 30+ years the system becomes ripe for corruption and those in power become deaf to constituents and alert to Catalyst or Scott Boone Consulting or what ever the hell they are calling themselves today.

The system will not change until you vote them out. There are very good candidates challenging the Incumbent Mayors. Flip a few of them and that will get the ball rolling to replace the good ole boy system with a government that represents us all.

## BAY MINETTE

If any Municipality needed a new Mayor. Its Bay Minette. Bay Minette deserves better than a Mayor who puts himself first and constituents lasts.

## SPANISH FORT

Brad Bass for Mayor Spanish Fort Alabama Our Fort. Our Future.

Slappin Mike should have been shown the door in the last election.

## Orange Beach

Orange Beach is a tourist town not a soap opera show.

Don’t forget mid term elections are coming up and there will be many more elected officials and judges that need to be voted out.
